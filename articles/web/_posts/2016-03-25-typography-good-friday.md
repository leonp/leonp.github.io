> Your vision isn't 20/20 anymore, just like 65% of the population, it’s worse than that. Like 4.25% of people on the planet you are color blind. You are now 1 in 10. You are dyslexic. Your phone is 3 years old. You can't afford a new one. Your data plan caps out at 3g and 1 gigabyte a month. The internet connection where you spend most of your time is not what you'd like it to be. &thinsp;&#8212;&thinsp; Adam Morse, <cite>[The Veil of Ignorance](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/)</cite>

It's always good &#8211; and perhaps increasingly rare &#8211; to discover writers on the web who make you think <i>yes, that is so right; everyone else is missing the  point</i>. So, introducing: [Adam Morse](http://mrmrs.io/writing/).

I think we appreciate a lot of what we serve is decorative, motivated by a fear of appearing different and/or unable to implement _x_ and _y_, which makes content less accessible. Expressing that thought directly and actually doing something about it is a different matter. This is [what made iA so vital a decade ago](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period).

In that spirit, I've [ditched web fonts](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/17/webfonts/) and [upped my line height](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2015/06/07/line-height/) to 1.6 (I prefer a tighter leading normally &#8211; we'll see how it goes).

## iOS system font bold missing

For some reason, iOS won't render headings in bold on my site. I'm using the system font (San Francisco) set to `font-weight: 700`. It's fine in OS X.

I've tried setting explicit numerical font weights and combinations of `-apple-system-body` and `-apple-system`, but nothing works. If you've got any ideas, [tweet me](https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster).
