			<p>Web and customer service manager. Occasional designer of websites for local businesses. Writes <a href="/articles">articles</a> about working on the web.</p>

			<p>Email <strong>leon.paternoster@zoho.com</strong>  &middot; <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster">@leonpaternoster</a></strong></p>

			<h2>Longer version</h2>

			<p>I'm web and customer service manager at <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a> (although I go under the fairly grandiose title of <em>deputy head of IT</em>). We design, build and manage our website in house, although the catalogue (the software you use to find, reserve and renew books) is provided by an outside company.</p>

			<p>In previous lives I've been a salesperson, telecoms engineer and teacher of English. If you were looking for a common thread in all that you might argue I've always been interested in communication, user experience and technology.</p>

			<p>I've got good CSS and HTML skills and know the basics of SASS, Grunt and Git. I've conducted lots of kiosk testing sessions over the years, as well as content audits and top task research. I also write a mean digital strategy.</p>

			<p>Occassionally I build websites for local businesses. Get in touch if you'd like to work with me.</p>
