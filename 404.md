title: That page doesn't exist

It looks like you've tried to reach a page on my site that doesn't exist. Apologies for the invonvenience.

This could be due to several reasons:

- You, or the person who gave you the link, mistyped it. Check your spelling.
- I deleted the page
- Your search engine hasn't indexed my site recently and has sent you to an old link

## What you can do

- <a href="/">Go to the home page</a>
- <a href="/archive">Try the archive and use the search box there</a>

If you think there's another problem, or would like to contact me anyway, try:

- leon . paternoster @ unseen . is (sans spaces)
- <a href="http://twitter.com/leonpaternoster">Me on Twitter</a>

Thanks,

Leon
