Complete rebuild of the library service website. Included customer research into popular tasks and a card sort exercise to help create a new site structure. I reviewed and rewrote any existing pages that were transferred to the new site, and I coded a responsive WordPress theme. 

## <a href="http://cultcafe.co.uk">Cult cafe</a>
	
Responsive site for the popular cafe and live music venue on Ipswich waterfront. I built a WordPress theme which incorporates a Google Calendar for events. Works perfectly on a mobile phone, which is vital for a business with lots of student customers.

A simple, responsive one page site that uses free Github Pages hosting. A good example of a basic website that includes all the important information an organisation needs to communicate, which made it cheap and quick to build.
