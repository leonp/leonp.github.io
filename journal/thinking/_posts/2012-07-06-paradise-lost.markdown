The republican, radical protestants have all the best poetry.

I wonder if I would have enjoyed Paradise Lost if I'd have studied it at sixth form or university. It would have been good, I think, to have some context and supporting information.

On the other hand, I don't think I'd have understood it or enjoyed it like I do now.

It's surprisingly easy to read. There's a story. And the poetry rumbles round and round, dizzyingly, like a spell.

> Thus repuls'd, our final hope<br>
Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br>
Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,<br>
And that must end us, that must be our cure,<br>
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,<br>
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br>
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,<br>
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost<br>
In the wide womb of uncreated night,<br>
Devoid of sense and motion?<br>
