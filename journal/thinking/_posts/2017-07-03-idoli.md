Listen to the first few seconds of this song. When and where do you think it's from? (Perhaps you know it already, and the band. Perhaps everyone does. Perhaps they're international superstars, supporting U2.)

That's a pretty cool, angular slice of tight, minimal, guitar/bass/drums rock. Gang of Fourish, perhaps, or even The Fall, complete with the spidery guitar figures (<i>cf</i> <cite>Impression of J Temperance</cite>).

So it does sound of its time (1981), but it's good enough to transcend that (in a way Gang of Four don't). And the really odd thing is it's from communist Yugoslavia (perhaps the <i>Paket Aranžman</i> gave it away). Just in case you were thinking there isn't enough obscure, brilliant music out there, this is <cite>Amerika</cite> by Idoli.
