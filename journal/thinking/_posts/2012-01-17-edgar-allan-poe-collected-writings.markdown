Read most the short stories, none of the poems and none of the essays. From what I remember, Poe's poetry is God awful.

Liked: Descent into the Maelstrom and the detective stories. The violence especially. Blokes sitting around in dim rooms. Ancestry and spectacular misanthropy. The old woman's hair found torn out, bits of scalp clinging to it. The orang-u-tang shaving his victim.
