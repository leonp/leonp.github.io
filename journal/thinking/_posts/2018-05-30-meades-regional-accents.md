[The latest Meades](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09xzsbp/jonathan-meades-on-jargon) was a bit of a mixed bag, with some fairly obvious targets (the law uses jargon, didn't you know, and the art world is full of pretentious wankers) and some high comedy (Meades as [Benny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossroads_%28UK_TV_series%29) was particularly good). As ever, there was provocative, laugh out loud stuff, including a skit on how regionalism and regional accents are _a bad thing_.

Meades evoked an age of <abbr title="Received pronunciation">RP</abbr> where you could have your Mancunian accent while enunciating "correctly" (note: you didn't have to sound like a BBC announcer). This meant the Edinburgh solicitor could easily converse with the Swansea surveyor. Regionalism, on the other hand, is, by definition, insular, non-communicative. It reminded me of one of Marx's great quotes, about [the bourgeoisie freeing us from the idiocy of rural life](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm).

Cue clips of Anthony Burgess and JP Priestly discussing literature and history in crystal clear, Northern accents, which Meades riffed on to compare with today's TV (again, rather obviously, the X Factor). There was a things-we've-lost subtext to the programme.

But I think I agree with this. There's something patronising and deeply conservative about celebrating regions and their accents, which the post-war generation fought to overcome (think <cite>Lucky Jim</cite> and <i>Merrie England</i>). Regional stereotypes tend to be stupid, the accents often impenetrable: as one great northerner put it <q>Who wants to be in a Hovis advert, anyway?</q>
