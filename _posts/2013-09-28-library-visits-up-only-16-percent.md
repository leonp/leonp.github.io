title: Library website visits increase 16% in 8 years&#8212;is that all?
---

According to a pretty slapdash <cite>Guardian</cite> piece, [visits to libraries have declined 12% since 2005&#8211;2006](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/27/library-visits-down-closures-continue).

(Actually, you're better off just reading the <cite><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/244895/Taking_Part_2013_14_Quarter_1_Report.doc.pdf">Taking Part</a></cite> report (PDF) yourself.)

Reword the oddly negative standfirst &#8211; try &#8220;36.2% Britons visited a library in the last year&#8221; instead &#8211; and the picture isn't quite as bleak as the article makes out. You could also point to ambitious projects in Birmingham and Manchester.

But there is a clear downward trend.

Better minds than mine will explain the reasons for this, but I suspect it's a combination of three things:

- *Lack of investment*. Libraries become shabbier, offer fewer exciting, new things and become less attractive places to visit.
- *Competition*. It's very easy to download a book from Amazon or a free classic from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org).
- *Lack of direction*. What are libraries for now? Should they be a place where you can find texts, or are they &#8216;third spaces&#8217;? A combination? And what does either mean in these times?

These factors affect each other. It's difficult to come up with a &#8216;vision&#8217; for libraries while [the service is being cut](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/education/nine-sunderland-libraries-to-close-as-council-bids-to-save-850-000-1-5765198).

On the plus side (maybe) visits to library websites are up. In 2005&#8211;06 8.9% of the public visited a library website. In 2012&#8211;13 the figure stood at 16.9%.

This is a somewhat murky figure &#8211; it doesn't seem *that* high to me &#8211; although the report describes it as &#8220;a significant increase&#8221;. I suspect Amazon's visitor figures are slightly more impressive.

Nonetheless, there's a trend here. Less people are visiting libraries, more people are visiting library websites.

## Who's thinking about library websites?

Apart from me, obviously :-)

If more people are visiting library websites this is good news for the library service and the public. Whether you borrow a physical or virtual book, you'll still read the thing.

Yet how much effort is put into the website &#8216;vision&#8217;? While Manchester and Birmingham build awesome new libraries, [their websites remain dire](https://library-opac.birmingham.gov.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/MSGTRN/OPAC/HOME): splintered, unfriendly, difficult to use. A joke compared to Amazon and Google.

The most important functions of a library website are to search, reserve and download books. Yet [catalogue searches are literal, frustrating experiences](/2013/06/libraries-should-invest-millions-in-search-engines/), light years behind Google, Amazon *et al* .

The ebook service has been outsourced with nary a thought &#8211; [the biggest ebook provider](http://www.overdrive.com) isn't even based in the UK, while catalogues sit in several separate places, away from the library's website. You can't download a UK library book to a Kindle.

Maybe that's why there's only been an 8% increase. It makes perfect sense that more people use library websites &#8211; but the increase should be in three figures.
