title: The things we gave away
layout: post

The things we lost: not having to worry about which school we or our kids went to, living somewhere cheaply, manufacturing, getting a job, keeping a job, getting a final salary pension, not getting into debt for going to university, owning utility companies, working sane hours, being able to tell our employer to fuck off, racism, sexism and homophobia, being able to afford football.

Or rather: the things we gave away.

What we got: owning a house, doing up a house, making a profit on a house, letting a second house, builders, &#8220;good catchment&#8221;, not everyone being the same, middle class tastes, gentrification, calling people chavs, commuting, estate agents, Benefits Street, service jobs, McJobs, Boden, made in China, not paying tax, iPhone, debt, more debt, triangulation, long hours, tiny pensions, banks collapsing.

What do you reckon? Worth it?
