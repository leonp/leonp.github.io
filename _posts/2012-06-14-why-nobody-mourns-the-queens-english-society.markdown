**[The problem](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/lack-of-interest-spells-the-end-for-the-queens-english-society-7814791.html) with** the [Queen's English Society](http://www.queens-english-society.com/) wasn't its obsession with apostrophes (tiresome though that no doubt is to 99% of the world). It was the name.

There are many ways to speak and write English, and there are many reasons for speaking and writing English in a particular way. One moment you're writing a blog post, the next you're tweeting or sending a text. It is worth knowing how to use an apostrophe correctly (or when to use one) because it'll make your meaning clearer when you're writing an essay. But that's different from saying a certain mode of English is _better_ than all the others.

English is spontaneous. It's absurd to try and impose one set of rules on everyone for use at all times. By conflating class (ma'am) and _proper_ usage you're basically saying that _your_ English isn't worthy. Which is a sure fire way of encouraging yet more _improper_ dialects.
