The web is a network links; they're what make plain, boring text _hyper_. Luckily, making a link is very, very easy, although crafting it properly takes a _little_ thought.

You only need to follow one rule to get links right:

_When you write link text, make sure it makes sense on its own._

It's surprising how many good writers get links wrong.

An example. You want to link to your organisation's annual report PDF (rather than publish an HTML version, but that's a different story). Many people write:

> To download our annual report, <a href="#">click here</a>

A better way:

> Download our <a href="#">annual report</a>.

(You can argue over whether to include the verb in your link; I don't, some would.)

## Why bother with writing links properly?

1. _Accessibility_. Screen readers can extricate the links in a page and read them in a list. _Click here_ makes no sense, _annual report_ does.
2. _Easing the reader's workload_. What is this link? Where does it lead? If the link doesn't make sense on its own, the reader has to reinterpret the words around it to figure out what it is.
3. _Easier scanning_. What's this document about? It's rare for a reader to work through your text from start to finish. Instead, they'll scan for words and phrases they're interested in. Links stand out from the rest of the text, so they're a key sign to the text's meaning.

The next time you're writing a link, spare it some thought. You'll make your readers' life a little easier.
