A year or so ago I posted [a guide to carrying out a content audit][1]. At the time I was getting to grips with the [Suffolk Libraries][2] website, and the audit was a really useful way to understand the library service and what we were trying to do online.

Now we have a (hopefully) sane IA and most of the redundant content has been stripped away, the audit has a different purpose. I use it to prune pages and make sure everything&#8217;s up to date. The original audit took days, now it takes on hour or two.

So here are 3 things you can do with a content audit once you&#8217;re happy with your website&#8217;s structure:

## 1. Make sure content is assigned to the right owner

Staff move on, go on paternity leave or get promoted. Your organisation structure changes too. Update your content owners accordingly.

## 2. Delete pages and files

The Suffolk Libraries website consists of 144 static pages, including redirects. This is manageable for one person.

Fewer pages and files make it easier to:

*   structure your website
*   return relevant results from searches
*   navigate pages

So the first question you need to ask of any page or file is *do we need this?* If you think the answer&#8217;s *no*, check your analytics and search logs and ask the content owner.

## 3. Update content

You&#8217;ll probably have an idea of what content needs updating, but the audit will *force* you to review everything. It&#8217;ll throw light on those obscure corners of the website you&#8217;d forgotten about.

Information ages quite naturally, but sometimes something unpredictable happens. For example, a new government might make changes to the National Curriculum, so your children&#8217;s reading advice pages might need updating.

Often content owners will come to you with changes, but it&#8217;s ultimately your responsibility to make sure everything&#8217;s up to date. And it&#8217;s a good thing when you show enough interest in other people&#8217;s content to ask questions about it.

The first content audit I did for Suffolk Libraries was a major piece of work, but it was really important to get a handle on the website. Now it&#8217;s a relatively painless way to keep the site lean and healthy.
