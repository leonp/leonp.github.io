title: Tabbed navigation didn&#8217;t work on our site

I was using [tabbed navigation][1] on a couple of the [Suffolk Libraries][2] website pages. By tabbed navigation I mean a single document&#8217;s content divided by horizontal tabs, so you don&#8217;t see it all at once.

It&#8217;ll look something like this:

<img src="http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tabs.gif" alt="Tabbed navigation within a page" width="860" height="216" />

<p class="figcaption">Tabbed navigation used to break up a single document.</p>

Tabs might seem a good idea because they break content up, thereby making it easier to interpret. But it&#8217;s the single design element that got the most complaints after my redesign.

It&#8217;s not that users didn&#8217;t get how to use the tabs (although initial testing indicated the labels had to be clearly styled as links â€“ in the picture above, users might have struggled identifying the tabs). No, it was simply because **tabs can break the back button**. Users see each tab as a separate page, when in reality they&#8217;re just parts of the same, single page. Although it might seem boring, I found in most cases it makes users&#8217; lives a lot easier if you actually make each tab a separate page, or plump for a single, long document, and find other ways to present it.
