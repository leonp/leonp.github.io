title: Basic citizen income&#8212;two examples of how it would work
---

Now, we all know a basic citizen income will never happen in the UK, because of <a href="/2013/09/basic-income/">our punitive attitude to benefits</a>. However, it's interesting to look at how it would affect us *if* we actually created a system that supported people regardless of their circumstances. We can but dream.

The following scenarios and figures are based on <a href="http://www.citizensincome.org/MoneyforEveryone.htm">Dr Malcolm Torry's work for the Citizen's Income Trust</a> (see Appendix 16). He claims the proposals are revenue neutral.

The state would give every citizen a fixed income regardless of their salary, pension, investment income, age and marital status. Dr Torry proposes income levels based on current income support and pension credit rates:

<p class="figcaption">Weekly basic citizen income amounts</p>

## Example 1

A and B are married and have two school aged children. A earns the national average wage of &pound;26,500 a year. B hasn't worked for four years in order to bring up the children. B would like to find a part&#8211;time job or course in order to begin a return to work.

The family collects &pound;160 a month in child tax credits and &pound;134 child benefit.

After tax and national insurance (NI) A takes home &pound;1700 a month. This results in an total income of &pound;1994 a month.

At the moment it's next to impossible for B to find work or study, because they'll lose their tax credits and have to start paying for pre and after school childcare, and any course costs.

Under a basic citizen income scheme A would pay more income tax because there'd be no tax allowance. Using the current tax rates, tax and NI add up to 32%, so A would take home &pound;1502 a month.

Basic income is paid to all citizens regardless of age. Using Torry's suggested rates, the family would receive &pound;1103 citizen income a month. This results in a total income of &pound;2605 a month, &pound;611 more than the current amount.

### How things would change

B could look for work without worrying about losing child tax credits. If the government also subsidised free childcare, it would be even more attractive. Study would be a realistic option.

There are also several indirect benefits. A currently pays &pound;60 accident, sickness and unemployment insurance. They wouldn't need to pay as much because redundancy wouldn't be as ruinous as before (moving to part&#8211;time work would be a realistic option, for example).

A could change their work hours to share childcare duties. It might be possible to go part&#8211;time in order to improve B's job and study prospects. 

A citizen income would drastically improve financial security, work and study flexibility and the quality of A and B's life (and their children's).

## Example 2

C brings up three children on their own. Their youngest child has turned 5, which means they have to move to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/what-youll-get">Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)</a> benefit of &pound;71.70 a week.

After 13 weeks they'll be put into a sinisterly named &#8220;work related activity group&#8221; and face sanctions if they don't attend job interviews or do &#8220;work&#8211;related activity&#8221;. <a href="http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/benefits_w/benefits_sick_or_disabled_people_and_carers_ew/employment_and_support_allowance.htm#work-related_activity">Work related activity</a> is work for free (also known as <a href="http://www.boycottworkfare.org/">workfare</a>).

They currently claim &pound;376.11 a month child tax credits and &pound;204.10 child benefit. Total income is &pound;890.91 a month.

C would like to either work part&#8211;time or, because they have no formal qualifications, begin an access course so they can train for a job.

C would lose their ESA under the current rules if they started a course.

Under the basic citizen income scheme, the family's income would increase by a modest &pound;148 a month to &pound;1038.91. C wouldn't have to start unpaid &#8220;work&#8211;related activity&#8221;, and they'd be free to either study or work part&#8211;time without losing any money.

### How things would change

C wouldn't have to worry about a change in circumstances affecting their children's well&#8211;being. They could also concentrate on planning some sort of career, rather than how their income changes on a week to week basis, or working for free.

A common theme to these examples is education. Another indirect consequence of a basic income would be a better trained workforce.

## Why it won't happen

If Torry's cost neutral claims are true, then it's hard to argue against a basic citizen income. They serve the government's aim of *getting people back to work* far better than the current means tested system.

If you're of a neoliberal bent they also open up several interesting possibilities around &#8216;flexible&#8217; labour laws. If unemployment isn't entirely financially ruinous, then zero hour contracts and no quibble hiring and firing may seem a little fairer than they do at the moment. (*Note &#8211; this isn't my view!*)

However, the main drawback is that an untested citizen income isn't punitive. In real life, A is encouraged to feel that they're paying for C to &#8216;do nothing&#8217; while they struggle on a low income, instead of questioning why their salary is so inadequate. Benefits and work are an exercise in division and revenge.
