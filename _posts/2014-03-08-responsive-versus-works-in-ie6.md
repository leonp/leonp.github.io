Stats from 4 days’ worth of [Suffolk Libraries][1] website traffic:

*   Proportion of visits from mobiles and tablets: 1 in 4
*   Proportion of visits using Internet Explorer 6: 1 in 500

The Suffolk Libraries website is responsive. Cost to build: £0 – I did it, so I guess there’s my web manager salary, but I do all the other web stuff too.

Let’s look at another library service’s website (or, more specifically, another library’s website): [The Library of Birmingham][2]. [Cost to build £1.2m][3]. Annual running costs £190,000. I don’t earn £190,000 a year.

Outsourcing isn’t always cheaper.

The Library of Birmingham’s website isn’t responsive.

It does, however, work in Internet Explorer 6. [They did ask for it to work in IE6][4].

Which is the most accessible?
