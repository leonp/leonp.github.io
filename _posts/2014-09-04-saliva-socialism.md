> I, uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the &#8211; the balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism. &#8212;<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall">Alvy Singer, Annie Hall</a></cite>

Alvy is talking about turning 40. I feel this way sometimes albeit I'm not one o&apos; those Jewish guys; nor balding, nor _just_ turning 40, for that matter.
