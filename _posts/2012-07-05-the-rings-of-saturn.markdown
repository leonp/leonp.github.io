Reading Sebald again, which is always a deep pleasure. This is my second run through his East Anglian pilgrimage.

On this reading the book strikes me as a meditation on entropy and insanity: Especially the author's (perhaps entirely reasonable) insanity. The apocalyptic visions and the bureaucratic, Germanic metronome used to describe  historical horrors.

Finished 4/7/12.
