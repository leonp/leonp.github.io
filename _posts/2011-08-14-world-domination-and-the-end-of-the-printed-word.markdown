You've made it when your brand name becomes interchangable with an object.

These things take time. Meaning accrues over decades. Vacuum cleaners become hoovers.

Does anyone buy an_ MP3 player_ these days? _MP3 player_ is quaint; the kind of term I use because I'm nearly 40 years old and don't bother with technology. iPod. Ipod.

Amazon may achieve proprietary eponymism even quicker than Apple with the Kindle (partly because _eâ€“reader_ is a tad uncomfortable). But that won't mean the end of the paper book, even if [Brewster Kahle's project is the stuff of novels](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/aug/01/internet-archive-books-brewster-kahle).

There's a bunker involved somewhere.
