Hard to believe, but once upon a time Delicious was a really great bookmarking service. The offer was very simple: install a plugin or bookmarklet and send all your bookmarks to your delicious account for synching and, more interestingly, sharing.

This was all before Facebook and Twitter took off. Back then, we weren't really interested in sharing personal updates &#8211; blogging and bookmarking were our online currency. And Delicious did bookmarks really well: the crowd determined what was popular, generating a folksonomy. There were no dismal clickbait lists or adverts, unlike now:

Delicious's history &#8211; and decline &#8211; is completely typical. In 2005 Yahoo bought the service, but divested it in 2011: as with most Yahoo ventures it never made money. Like a bad debt, various companies have taken the service on, only to sell it after a couple of years.

What made Delicious good was its non-commercial nature. Other users rather than advertisers determined what links surfaced. But investors want a return on their investment, and the only way to do that online seems to be through plastering a site with crap adverts (or moments). And then people stop using the service.

There do appear to be [some signs of life in Delicious](http://blog.delicious.com/2016/01/delicious-changes/); it would be nice to think it could return to its former glory. But the fact it'll be funded by ads suggests that isn't going to happen.
