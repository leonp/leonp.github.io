I actually rather like the design of [this site](http://www.optimasgroup.com/), but one does have to wonder if the writers have written for human beings before:


> We help business owners intelligently align their business mission, strategic direction, and tactical implementation.




> To realize maximum return on the financial and psychological capital investment (ROI) for our clients.


I mean, aligning a tactical implementation sounds confusing enough, but doing this _intelligently_ as opposed to _unintelligently_?

And where do I find the _psychological capital investment_ markets?
