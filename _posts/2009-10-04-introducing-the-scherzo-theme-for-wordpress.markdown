## Installation


Install in the normal way, i.e. extract the scherzo.zip file and upload it to your themes folder. Login to your dashboard and select the theme from the Appearance menu.


## Responsive layout


Scherzo will scale to fit any screen width. This means you can view the theme on mobile devices without installing any plugins. To see how it works either [view the live demo](http://leonpaternoster.com/scherzo) on a mobile phone or shrink your browser window.
