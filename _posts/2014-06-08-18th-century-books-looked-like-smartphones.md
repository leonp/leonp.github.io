Liked this picture of an 18th century book <cite>Conjectures on Original Composition</cite> by Edward Young:

It shows how resilient we are as readers – we can deal with any ‘difficult’ measure. Another possible similarity between now and then is the sheer *mass* of the stuff we&#8217;re publishing; a fact plenty will bemoan, but I rather like this democratic, unpretentious fecundity (he said, pretentiously…) Also chimes with [something I wrote many moons ago][2].
