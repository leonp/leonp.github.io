Tell me — when you [read this blog post][1] (note: it was pulled by Mozilla, but you can [grab an archived page][2]), what&#8217;s the most important thing it conveys?

Finished it? Good.

So, was it:

*   Mozilla designs things for its users?
*   Mozilla is improving its start page?
*   Mozilla is selling ads on its start page?

Which of those statements do you think Mozilla wants you to remember?

And which is the biggest news to Mozilla blog readers?

Here&#8217;s that article in numbers:

*   Number of paragraphs before adverts are mentioned: 7
*   Number of words in sentence announcing adverts: 39
*   Number of words in said sentence before adverts are mentioned: 26
*   Number of features mentioned before adverts in said sentence: 2
*   Number of times the word “advert” is used: 0
*   Number of times the word “user” or “users” is used: 12
*   Number of buzzword verbs: 9 (“align”, “deliver” etc.)
*   Number of references to irrelevant business meetings: 1

You get the picture.

I&#8217;m not sure what I think about Mozilla selling ads. It *feels* wrong, but perhaps it wouldn&#8217;t bother me – I&#8217;d just ignore start page ads just as I ignore every other ad I see on the internet. I would miss history tiles, especially on Firefox mobile.

What does bother me is the confusing, buzzword ridden language they use to tell us something relatively important. Has it always been this way? Or is it something new? Whatever the answer, it makes me suspicious.

(Yes, I do like [Fira Sans][3], though.)
