Many moons ago I linked to the [Rainfall Daffinson](http://rainfall-daffinson.com/) website as [an example of confident, simple design](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/09/really-simple-web-design-an-example/). At lunch today I was thumbing through my blog and thought I'd see if anything had changed. It has:

[caption id="attachment_2389" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="The Rainfall Daffinson website uses text instead of images in its portfolio"][![Screenshot of the Rainfall Daffinson website](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rainfall.jpg)](http://rainfall-daffinson.com/)[/caption]

I still really like the site. What struck me this time is the use of paragraphs on the portfolio page. 99% of portfolios use a thumbnail or (shudder) a jquery slider to present work. Probably because people think ‘proper’ web design involves making things move around.

But why not use text? Each portfolio entry has a distinct presence on the page. It looks neat, and we can still go and look at the work. Effortlessly _individual_.

It's also inherently mobile friendly. The HTML weighs in at a super light 2.2Kb. It's just a shame the layout doesn't adapt to the viewport.
