History repeats itself quickly in the world of web design – it seems like only yesterday [we were lambasting <cite>Design Observer</cite> for its new–not–at–all–new design][1].

Fast forward to 2014 and we&#8217;re making the [same criticisms][2]: poor font choice, tiny, indistinct type, bugginess. Add some really slow loading and unresponsiveness and you have 2014&#8242;s version (although to be fair the site sort of adjusts to my Nexus phone – I&#8217;m guessing it sniffs rather than scales).

<p class="figcaption"><cite>Design Observer</cite>: Let me count the ways</p>

And yet. This website wasn&#8217;t really written for me. I&#8217;d go as far as to say I don&#8217;t even understand it.

Who exactly is it for? Older design veterans who don&#8217;t deal in the grubby functionality of fluid sized screens (i.e. [designers who aren&#8217;t working class][4])? If that is the case then – actual crapness (the huge fixed header, the strange dropdown at the top of the screen etc.) aside – it may do its job well enough.

If you dig seeing paragraphs set in Archer on screen, and like small blocks of text, and spend your day on a Mac with a large screen, <cite>Design Observer</cite> has been *designed* just for you.
