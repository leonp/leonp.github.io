England, how they failed thee, let me count the ways…

You weren&#8217;t good enough, you weren&#8217;t patriotic enough, you had no true identity, you don&#8217;t know how to play tournaments, things never change, your players are paid too much, your players don&#8217;t play enough, your players are too honest.

And so on.

Here&#8217;s a crazy idea: your coach was crap.

International tournament football is very simple. You get a lucky or unlucky draw, you select from a pool of good or not so good players, you get some good or bad luck and you play your hand accordingly. There&#8217;s no long season or youth team to consider, just (at most) 7 matches.<figure class="figure aligncenter">

Now, if you look at England&#8217;s hand you&#8217;ll see it was OK. An average draw and a decent group of players. Minimum success? Round two, I&#8217;d say, although maybe the quarter finals.

No matter how poor you think the England players are, they&#8217;re better than Costa Rica and Uruguay&#8217;s. They&#8217;d never win the World Cup, but they&#8217;re probably better than Italy&#8217;s, on the whole.

Roy Hodgson&#8217;s job was to organise his players so they scored more goals than their opponents over the course of three matches. By any standard, he failed to do this remotely well.

The Italian manager resigned after failing to get out of England&#8217;s group. Even the Honduras manager resigned. Only the England manager and Fabio Capello never resign.

England&#8217;s expectations are low, so Roy escapes with his reputation in tact, even a little enhanced by the way he managed disappointment. It’s football bureacracia – where you can apply all sorts of success criteria beyond actually winning games. We’re building for the future. We have a plan. As Harry Redknapp says, Roy fits nicely into this world.

Exactly the same thing’s happened at Ipswich Town, where simply not going into administration is seen as a major source of pride. Not being deliriously happy at utter mediocrity is seen as a sign of unrealism.

So Uncle Roy bumbles around happily enough to no discernible purpose, except to be likeable, if a little longwinded, at press conferences. And then we&#8217;ll do badly at the 2016 Euro Championships.
