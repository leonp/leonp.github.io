title: The UK Government website's look
---

Chatting about a website redesign recently and someone mentioned it was going to look like the [UK government's much lauded website](http://gov.uk).

Now, I think the UK government's website is brilliant. I guess I like the way it looks. But what I *admire* is its approach to content and structure.

The gov.uk website does thousands of things for 60m plus British people. By definition, it's a hugely complicated beast.

The only logical way to structure and present its content is to strip out extraneous words and images. No noise at all. Lots of lists and signpost pages.

Of course, this is all commonsense, but in the web design world simply presenting information well is never enough. Designers think about brand, filling space, making the page look nice etc. etc. (This isn't a new story.)

So the gov.uk website is remarkable because it does something that everybody says you should do but doesn't have the balls to actually do.

And its unique *look* is a consequence of this bravery and a number of factors, such as a complex IA, a huge number of customer tasks, its information density and the need to work on lots of different devices.

To try and achieve a look that mimics such an essentially functional site is bizarre.

Would this look work for all websites? The question doesn't even make sense &#8211; a look should be a response to a set of circumstances.
