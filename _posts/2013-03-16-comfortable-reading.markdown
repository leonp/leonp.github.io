And…

There are two things here. Firstly, the gut reaction to [_really_ big text](http://www.zeldman.com/). It's like being hit. But we get used to it and big becomes bigger.

Secondly: The physical relaxation we experience when we don't need to _peer_ (i.e. lean forward and contract our forehead muscles). When we can lean back, relax the centre of our back and breathe more friendly. Comfortable reading as a sum of muscle relaxations.

It's not just font size, but that's a major part of it.
