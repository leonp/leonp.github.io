I feel this way sometimes (albeit I'm not one o&apos; those Jewish guys, nor balding, for that matter). I've always voted Labour and been of the left, but I was like everyone in the 90s and 2000s, left and right. I wasn't really that bothered. Guess that was because, generally, there seemed to be enough money sloshing around, and everything seemed just OK.

That all changed in 2008, and then in 2010 the Tories got into power. Worse than Thatcher in the 80s. My God! Gove and Ian Duncan Smith. The Bedroom Tax. Philip Hammond. Jeremy Hunt. Horrible.

And us lefties were left&hellip; dangling. Things hadn't been so OK in the 90s and 2000s after all, and soon fell apart &#8211; because no one had been bothered. There was nowhere to vote, no one to get inspired by. Labour had shifted a smidgeon to the left of the Tories. My God! Simon Danczuk! What to do apart from reread our Marx, buy some chairman Zizek and grumble in a blog?

In other European countries there were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_%28Germany%29">various degrees of the proper left</a> to get behind. True, the far right's flourished over on the mainland too. But that's all we have here, friggin' UKIP. And Boris Johnson.

All thouroughly depressing. Yes, Labour's a broad church, but <a href="http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/opinion/16910-liquidating-labour">do we really believe we can change things from the inside</a> and avoid a Tory&#8211;lite Labour government in 2015? Not when the political parties feel they have to play a defensive <a href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/08/lord-ashcrofts-poll-shows-a-swing-to-labour-in-tory-held-marginal-seats/">swing voters in 100 or so marginal seats game</a> in order to win.
