I'm a [Fall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(band)) fan. Any Fall pop biog will inevitably mention two facts about the band:



	
  1. Singer Mark E Smith has fired lots of band members

	
  2. The Fall have released more than 30 albums over 30 years


I _love_ the fact that The Fall _produce_ so much. While [The Stone Roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_roses) took 5 years to release their second (not–very–good) album, The Fall released 5 albums, including _Extricate_ and _Code: Selfish_.

So when it comes to writing something as immediate and easy–to–publish as a blog post, bloggers shouldn't get _too_ precious and start criticising others for publishing _unthoughtful_ articles while they sit and do nada, all in the name of _quality_.

There are, of course, plenty of valid reasons for not publishing: work commitments, kids, life, boredom, lack of inspiration included, but those who aren't publishing really shouldn't indulge in a bout of concerned chin stroking at the state of blogging.

Was that a rant?
