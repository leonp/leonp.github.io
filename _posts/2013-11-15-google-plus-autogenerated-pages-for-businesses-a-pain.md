title: Google plus auto generated pages cause problems

Nobody really wants Google Plus but Google is dying for you to want Plus.

The integration with and assimilation of various services (prediction: Blogspot will be soon), and the constant invocations to use Plus are ignorable annoyances. When it affects your work it becomes a problem.

Plus automatically generates pages for your business, whether you want it to or not. I don't see how you can *make* people use something they don't want to use, but this appears to be Google's main marketing tactic.

Google then ratchet up the pressure by giving Plus summaries a prominent place in some search engine results listings.

Try a search for *<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ipswich+county+library#q=county+library+ipswich">County Library Ipswich</a>* to see what I mean.

Now, this would perhaps be harmless if the information was useful. But we changed the County Library contact number recently, and the Plus listing is incorrect.

Which means the most prominent phone number on the search results page is wrong.

Claiming a Plus business page means getting Google to call you with a <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>. Difficult when the phone number they have is wrong.

Alternatively, they can send a postcard with the PIN on it. Just hope it gets through when the postcode's also wrong.

Frankly, this is a load of bollocks from Google. There's no way Plus should get a higher search engine ranking than the website page, and I'm not aware of any mechanism to stop them creating the page in the first place.

The sooner Plus's inevitable demise comes, the better.
