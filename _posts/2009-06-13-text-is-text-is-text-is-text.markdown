Pah. Graphic designers.

As we all know, [typography isn't about choosing a font face](http://ilovetypography.com/2008/04/04/on-choosing-type/). If we only have a handful of fonts to choose from, so be it.

Web documents are, well, _documents_. And HTML5 will make this fact clearer: try writing a document in HTML5 (and [it is possible to write HTML5 using `section`, `article`, `aside`](http://orderedlist.com/articles/structural-tags-in-html5) etc. etc.) It's an interesting experience: you can't get away with throwing in the odd sloppily named `div` — you have to think carefully about the _semantic_ structure of the page, not the visual structure.

HTML5 is the most exciting thing in web design at the moment.

Web pages aren't posters. There's a misplaced reverence for the printed page: the web page isn't the printed page's lesser sibling.

There's nothing wrong with web pages that don't look like posters. Even pages that look conventional or _boring_. The primary purpose of a web page's design is to make the content _readable _and accessible. It's not to look _nice_. That's why CSS galleries are a complete waste of time: when you look at an image of a web page it's like looking at a painting. You're thinking about proportion, tone, etc. You're not interpreting the information it's trying to convey.

Typography is not an adjunct of art. It's _sole_ purpose is to make the page's content clear. This is possible with Georgia, and even (gulp) Arial.

So it's good [when people redesign their blogs so they look entirely normal](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/06/12/redesigned/). Two columns, a splash of colour and Georgia can take you a long way.
