title: Google and Apple, parasites and deleting your internet history
---

I stumbled on (and enjoyed) *[The Entrepreneurial State](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01hnv70)*, a *Global Business* programme with [professor Mariana Mazzucato](http://www.marianamazzucato.com) aired on the World Service last Sunday.

(Incidentally, it's also nice to hear a BBC radio business programme that isn't presented by a couple of city boys.)

Professor Mazzucato argues the Googles and Apples of this world enjoy a parasitic relationship with the state.

On the one hand they portray a huge, lumbering beast, obstructing the innovation, change, progress etc. they drive. The beast must be restrained and cut down to size (and not fed taxes, presumably).

At the same time their products rely on infrastructure the state invented: GPS, the internet, touch screens etc.

Mazzucato warns the Google worldview has too much sway over government. Without a strong, &#8216;entrepreneurial&#8217; state, unemployment will increase while a few superrich &#8216;innovators&#8217; get richer.

This chimed nicely with one of [Morozov's three internet intellectual fallacies](http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2013-10/morozov-sharknado-chomsky-foucault), namely *origins*:

> The origins fallacy&hellip; confuses causes and effects, assuming that our current digital infrastructure &#8211; &#8220;the Internet&#8221; &#8211; gave rise to our practices and behaviors &#8211; and not vice versa. Thus, the story of every single component of &#8220;the Internet&#8221; is retold through the history of &#8220;the Internet&#8221; itself. <cite>&#8212;&thinsp;Evgeny Morozov: How to Stop a Sharknado</cite>
