So it begins. It's a beast (a megalosaurus, to be precise).

The original was published in twenty instalments. Perhaps that's the best way to read it; weekly, while reading something shorter in one go.

The fog in the Temple is great, of course.

It's _World Book Day_ and I am 37% of the way through this book, according to my Kindle.

The good: the way Dickens takes everything (the city, the weather, the land, the world, history, time) and bends it to his view. The night Tulkinghorn is shot is probably the single most atmospheric piece of writing I have ever read. The scale. The humour. The characters. The scale and degrees of good and evil.

The bad: the way every character ends up related in some way to every other character. The sentimentality. The tying-up of loose ends.
