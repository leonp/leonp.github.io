I have two business ideas that, if I had the money, time or business know how, I'd make a killing from.

The first is a Library Management System (LMS) with a simple, open API, and a search that's designed for the public. Currently, LMSs are rooted in a monolithic, local government world of design that's about 20 years out of date. They're clunky, closed and difficult to use.

Libraries have tons of extraordinary content. A modern LMS would give users and libraries easy access to all of it.

The second is a service for local news co–operatives, similar to the [Banyan Project](http://banyanproject.coop/). It'd consist of a WordPress theme with a few easy to customise options, such as typeface, colour and logo, support and hosting, and advice on setting up a co–op. All very big society, I know, but a possibly viable model for good quality local news.

The WordPress theme would shamelessly rip off the [ITV News](http://www.itv.com/news/) website's model. [Their current design went live a year ago](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/05/social-mobile-the-dynamite-combo-itv-news-needed-to-build-reputation-and-audience/), and it's still the best out there.

A few years back online news tried to ape its older print brother. For a while, grids were all the rage because they made home pages look like newspaper front pages, albeit with dozens more stories.

The ITV website uses a blog–like list instead of a complex grid. On a screen, this _stream_ is easy to scan.

But what's even more radical is the move away from the _article_. The ITV website does publish longish pieces, but it'll also push tweets, photos, asides and [one sentence updates](http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-05-11/turkey-deputy-pm-bombers-had-links-to-syrian-regime/) to the stream.

Articles take time to write, which is fine when you're publishing to a strict, daily schedule, but unwieldy when you can publish anything instantly online.

Combine this with the online reader's bitty approach to consuming information, and the freedom it gives journalists to write more flexible content, and you have a news design that makes full use of the technology it's built on.

This model would suit small scale, hyperlocal publications. You can generate a lot of content in a short amount of time with only a handful of authors.

Of course, the format isn't new. Tumblr's been around for years and WordPress has boasted post formats (asides, updates, images etc.) since version 2. Add a custom taxonomy that lets editors group posts into stories and you'd be pretty much there.
