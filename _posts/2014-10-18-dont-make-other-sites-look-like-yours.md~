title: We don't make other sites look like our site

At work, our approach (or &#8216;strategy&#8217;, if you like) is to incorporate as many services on our own website as possible. So if a customer wants to find a book ideally they'd go to `http://suffolklibraries.co.uk`, search for it and reserve it all on `http://suffolklibraries.co.uk`. The same goes for ebooks, except you'd download the book after you'd found it.
