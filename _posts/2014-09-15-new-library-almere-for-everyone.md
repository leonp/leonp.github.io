Noted: an <a href="http://www.shareable.net/blog/how-a-new-dutch-library-smashed-attendance-records">article on the <i>Nieuwe Bibliotheek</i> in the Dutch town of Almere</a>.

This is what you want libraries to look like:

I wonder if this approach to libraries is common in Dutch and other European towns. In Suffolk, we do children's events and the nuts and bolts of lending really well. We'll also help older customers get online and offer people who don't have access to their own PC pretty much unlimited time on a computer, which is particularly helpful if you need to complete your <abbr title="Department of Work and Pensions">DWP</abbr> forms online.

This is all noble and important work, but it's primarily aimed at *helping* certain groups in some way. What about people who don't really need help? Who just want to enjoy some time in a library.

That's what I like about the Almere New Library, and I hear <a href="http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/practitioners/big-new-libraries-manchester">similar good things about British libraries</a>. They're just somewhere you, or anybody, would like to go; better than, say, Starbucks.

In other words, libraries should be a <a href="/2014/09/in-praise-of-universality/">universal</a> service.
