title: Language affects line width
category: work

Enjoyed this [Smashing Mag piece on building layouts based on line width](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/01/logical-breakpoints-responsive-design/), particularly the _I'm no expert_ tone. Exactly what a ‘content first’ approach demands, and I think it can also be applied to sites that display forms instead of lots of paragraphs. Of course, designing for text heavy sites is a lot easier, and more fun.

Interesting to note that it makes a difference whether you aim for a certain **number of characters or words per line**. If it's characters then your language doesn't matter. If it's words (and I've always aimed for 10–12 words per line because the eye shifts at a new word rather than a new character) then it's going to affect your calculation.

(Incidentally, a width unit based on number of words per line would be interesting.)

German words are longer than English. That means **German needs a wider measure than English**, if you're aiming for a certain number of words per line.

Note the density of long-to-English-eyes words.[/caption]

Finally, [line width is complicated](http://blog.fawny.org/2005/09/21/measures/). Readers are pretty tough; long lines aren't necessarily detrimental to comprehension, although they do seem to affect the **reader's experience**.
