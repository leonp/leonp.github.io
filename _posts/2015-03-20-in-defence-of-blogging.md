Matt is right in one sense: the term [‘blogging’ sounds oddly old-fashioned](http://mattgemmell.com/on-blogs/). Blogs were big a decade or so ago &#8211; everyone was at it on Blogger, wordpress.com and Typepad, banging out all sorts of updates.

Now, you’ve got Facebook and Twitter for that _what I had for dinner_ stuff, but some of us are still writing _posts_ on _blogs_. Or _blogging_. Yes, the content is generally more professional, and in most ways better. But that doesn't mean the format is cheap, or that we've suddenly become journalists, publishers or even writers.

One of the joys of the internet is that _anyone_ can post stuff. That does of course mean there's a lot of crap out there, but there's also insightful, high quality prose from amateurs and beginners. While terms like _publish_, _journal_ and _anthology_ indicate quality and professionalism, they necessarily act as a bar to expression.

These terms come from the traditional, print world of magazines, books and academic journals. The web is different &#8211; democratic and chaotic. Let's embrace an appropriate &#8211; ugly, even &#8211; lingo to describe it.
