title: Teachers, Tories and QTS
---

I really don't understand this Tory hostility to the teaching *profession*.

Take this bizarre [article on how unqualified teachers have inspired students](http://www.conservativehome.com/thecolumnists/2013/11/from-adrian_hilton-unqualified-teachers-have-inspired-generations-of-children.html) for &#8216;generations&#8217;.

You'd expect the author to give us some examples of unqualified teachers teaching real students. OK, they might be limited to private schools, but at least we'd get an idea of how it works.

Instead, Hilton cites [a fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Them_All_My_Days) and a teacher whose class consisted of [one stammering king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King's_Speech).

The [teacher who does work in the real world](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/educating-yorkshire) has Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).

<p class="figcaption">William Golding was a Nobel&#8211;prize&#8211;winning author and a lousy teacher. He'd set work and spend the lesson writing <cite>Lord of the Flies</cite>.</p>

The article comments demonstrate the wilful ignorance (and prejudice) of many Tories towards teaching and teaching standards.

I used to be a teacher of English. [QTS](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/208682/Teachers__Standards_2013.pdf) (PDF) consists of a set of 40 or so standards you have to show you've met over the course of your training.

Some Tories seem to think they're &#8220;meaningless&#8221;, no reflection of subject knowledge or, when they're at their most paranoid, some sort of &#8216;politically correct&#8217; checklist.

In truth, they're practical. They cover things like classroom management, lesson planning and &#8211; yes &#8211; subject knowledge.

Of course, QTS doesn't automatically make you a good teacher, just as medical training doesn't automatically make you a good doctor. But it does help prepare you for the terrors of the classroom or, at the very least, weed out the truly incapable.

Do Tories *really* think teachers are a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2298146/I-refuse-surrender-Marxist-teachers-hell-bent-destroying-schools-Education-Secretary-berates-new-enemies-promise-opposing-plans.html">highly organised, far left, militant group</a>? Does this explain their attitude to the profession as a whole? If only this was the case.

No. Teachers are a generally normal bunch, probably more to the left than your average office, but some of them are &#8211; gasp &#8211; Tories. Yet Gove and his ilk seem hellbent on making an enemy of them.
