I loved this [Will Self piece on English Heritage and its demerging and museumification of Stonehenge][1] (both are words because authors create words).

Two things:

> Stonehenge stands at the centre of a complex web of ideas linking ownership, knowledge and consumption.

So Stonehenge’s meaning changes over time, and doesn’t become fixed in, say, 1920. Fittingly, we now have a neoliberal circle of stones.

And:

> Given the vast timescale over which humans have interacted with the English landscape, it seems plausible that archaeologists of the distant future will concoct some narrative to unify these works with the stones themselves, perhaps one based on the astronomical alignment of the tunnel with the decayed footings of some vast M-shaped golden arches that were mysteriously erected some decades later.

You can picture deadly earnest archaeologists, trowels dangling, theorising with a glint in their eye over MacDonalds and leylines on a BBC4 Stonehenge Watch in 3145.

Despite its fantastic age Stonehenge has absolutely zero inherent meaning. Nothing in Britain, or anywhere else, does. Yet we can’t create anything exciting from Stonehenge, or find new, meaningful sites to theorise over. Might as well build a Prince Charles designed, Crest Nicolson, faux Georgian housing estate around it.
