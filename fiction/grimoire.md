A whatsapp from the girlfriend at 11.40 _Come now. He’s in truble_ which was unarguable judging by the screams. I politely manouvered a couple of worried, pyjamaed neighbours out of the way – _It’s OK,_ I lied, _I’m a doctor &#8211; cancer,_ nodding toward the house.

The girl, shitscared, pointed me up the stairs. An _OK_ and a reassuring squeeze of the arm. Strangely invasive that; might leave bruises.

_Ah! It’s here!_ he shrieked.

The screams became manic laughter.

_‘s OK! I’m here!_ Important she heard that.

I paused before turning the handle. The room went quiet.

I whispered: _It’s me_

An ugly falling noise from inside. _Shhh!_ I gently pushed the door open.

He lay on the floor, a jumble of arms and legs, a binliner of unwanted clothes.

_Don’t come up here!_

There was an iPad by the body, emitting an eldritch glow. _Too easy to find stuff._
