A whatsapp from the girlfriend at 11.40 _Come now. He’s in truble_ which was unarguable judging by the screams. I politely manouvered a couple of pyjamaed neighbours out of the way – _It’s OK_ I lied _I’m a doctor. Cancer_.

The girl, shitscared, pointed me up the stairs. An _OK_ and a reassuring grab of the arm. Strangely invasive gesture that, might leave bruises.

_Ah! It’s here!_ he shrieked.

The screams became manic laughter.

_‘s OK! I’m here!_ Pointless, but she needed to hear. I paused before turning the handle, and it went quiet in the room.

I whispered: _It’s me._

An ugly falling noise from inside. _Shhh!_

He lay on the floor, a jumble of arms and legs, a binliner of unwanted clothes.

_Don’t come up here!_

There was an iPad by the body. Perfect. Yes, mad Abdul Alhazred’s text. I’ll need to get that fixed quickly.
