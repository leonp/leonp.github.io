NOTES
=====

I use the Pure CSS framework.

Extensions to modules are named pure module name-custom. When I use an extension the element will have 2 class names: the pure name and the new custom name.

Extensions have their own sass file, which reflects the module name.

Additional modules are named lp-module-name. Each additional module has its own SCSS file, which reflects the module name.

Variables are named variable-type-variable-name patter
