> <i>Colophon</i>: a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication&hellip; Some web pages also have colophons &thinsp;&#8212;&thinsp; <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))</cite>

So, here you go&hellip;

This website changes. However, it's been published using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a [static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/)) since 2013. It's also been hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) since then.

At the time of writing, it uses a system serif for most of the text (paragraphs and lists, for example). The font stack is `'Charter', 'Roboto Slab', cambria, georgia, serif`.

It uses your system typeface for headings and captions, which will be a sans serif. Your system typeface will depend on your operating system. If you use Mac OS X or iOS it'll be San Francisco, if you use a Windows device it'll be Segoe UI and if you use an Android device it'll be Roboto. Firefox OS uses Fira Sans.

I'm using system fonts because web fonts will slow your page down.
