Jaki Liebezeit died yesterday. Perhaps surprisingly, he was 78, born just before the Second World War, nine years ahead of David Bowie. When [Can](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)) &#8211; for whom Liebezeit drummed &#8211; released <cite>Monster Movie</cite> he was already a not particularly rock'n'roll 31 years old.

Can weren't rock'n'roll. <i>Krautrock</i> wasn't rock'n'roll. Instead, they molded funk, jazz, Turkish (<i>Can</i> is the Turkish word for <i>peace</i>) African, experimental, classical and rock'n'roll music into something very European. That's not to say it was a gruesome world music in a Peter Gabriel way (although Can did head down that road): at their best, Can were _hard_ &#8211; repetitive, simple, direct and complex all at the same time. And driven by _that_ incredible beat; again, both intricate and plain. _Very_ funky, but not like funk.

Germanic, African, classical, high magic funk, as Julian Cope might say. Beyond genre.

Can could have been horrible.

Like so many of the Krautock <i>ubermenschen</i> and <i>frauen</i>, Liebezeit lived a materially modest life, largely anonymous in his KÃ¶ln home, [packing up his own gear at the end of a gig](https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/jan/23/can-jaki-liebezeit-drummer-krautrock). This is not a cause for anger. Can were a collective (Can is also an acronym: _communism, anarchism, nihlism_), just as Neu, Faust and [Cluster](/2015/07/moebius-schlage/) were. Anti-celebrities, not posing stars. Can weren't Oasis.

I could post dozens of jawdropping, headnodding Leibezeit snippets, but here's one of my favourites &#8211; Can live, extemporising <cite>Vitamin C</cite>, the first song I heard with _that_ rhythm:
