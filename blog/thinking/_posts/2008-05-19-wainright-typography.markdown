**Referring to [A Wainright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wainwright)**; a rather likeable if somewhat stereotypically uptight Englishman who was famous for writing guides to walking in the Lake District. Mr Wainright visited London once, and didn't like it.

His books were handwritten. I guess handwriting was better back then? The font Wainright deploys (creates?) and his flair for layout are perhaps major reasons for their popularity?
