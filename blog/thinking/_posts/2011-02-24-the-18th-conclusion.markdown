> Item. It is no better for laymen to say the pater noster than to say “bibull babull” <cite>Conclusion no.18 of The 18 Conclusions of the pre–destined men</cite>


The pre-destined men were a medieval sect who believed that man's destiny — and salvation — was pre-ordained by God. Priestly intercession was therefore completely unnecessary. I had a teenage friend whose evangelical church preached the same thing.

Apparently the 18 Conclusions can be found in a manuscript in the British Library.
