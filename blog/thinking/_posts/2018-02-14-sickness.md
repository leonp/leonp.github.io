Mark as a lyricist on sickness: <cite>Fit and Working Again</cite>, <cite>Dedication not Medication</cite>, <cite>Dr Buck's Letter</cite>, <cite>Everything Hurtz</cite>, <cite>Sleep Debt Snatches</cite>, <cite>Blindness</cite>, <cite>Bill is Dead</cite>. Probably more.

Mark as a vocalist, ill-sounding: The death rattle at the end of <cite>Hittite Man</cite>, the wailing in <cite>Dedication not Medication</cite>, the gurgling at the start of <cite>Remainderer R</cite>, the post-chest infection wheeziness of <cite>Barmy</cite>, the craziness of "Lost the plot" repeated six times in <cite>Mad.Men-Eng.Dog</cite>, the breathless whispering at the end of <cite>Weather Report 2</cite>.

Mark was often ill, so illness became a part of The Fall, and the creation of the artist known as Mark E Smith&hellip; The group exhorts us to [remember Mark the artist rather than the fact he left his teeth in Badly Drawn Boy's Audi](https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/27867272_10204085371811714_6929157844815590722_n.jpg?oh=97298ca9cdd17d718c7cae5849d91e68&oe=5B2357E1), and this is one of the many things unique about Mark's work. I can't think of any other musician with the talent or sheer will to be able to transform modern, everyday experience into some form of timeless art.

> In the midst of the agony of a headache which lasted three days accompanied by violent nausea I was possessed of most singular dialectical clarity and very cold-bloodedly I then thought out things for which in my more healthy moments I am not enough of a climber, not sufficiently subtle, not sufficiently cold enough. &#8212; Nietzsche, <cite>Ecce Homo</cite>
