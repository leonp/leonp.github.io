I am a political animal, geeky enough to get excited by the predictions, counts and shocks of each electoral cycle &#8211; even if I've long given up on voting for the winning team, especially after moving to a parliamentary seat boasting a 20,000 Tory majority.

This time round is, according to every commentator, odd. The incumbent appears to be set for a large majority, something I *feel* will happen as we approach Brexit; the defining, class-stradling issue of our times. Decades old Labour constituencies may turn blue.

This would of course normally spell disaster for Labour, but I also feel we've made progress over the last few months. For the first time in decades the party published a clearly social democratic manifesto. Overnight, Corbyn cut through Labour's tortuous deficit trap by taxing high earners more and borrowing for infrastrucure. And the people did say <q>yea</q>. [The centre has moved left](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/29/election-centre-ground-left-labour-tory-manifestos). I think Corbyn will be able to claim some sort of victory in this; in a sense, he has already won by bringing new (old) ideas into play.

It's the apparently pragmatic Labour right which will have all the questions to answer? What next? What do you actually stand for?

Decades of New Labour orthodoxy take a long time to change. One almost single-issue election isn't enough.

I've been particularly interested in how the media reports and forms this narrative. Broadly, the story from all traditional outlets has been one of Labour's destruction. But how to demonstrate this? I've noticed all newspapers going strong on vox pops, from this [rock up and quote the local Tory](https://www.ft.com/content/a667b85c-4469-11e7-8519-9f94ee97d996) piece in the FT, to more [in depth articles from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/voices-and-votes). I guess the reasons for this are obvious enough: polls don't tell the full (or accurate) story, the media bubble never speaks to real people etc. etc.

Again, these conclusions _seem_ plausible &#8211; I can see loads of Northern and Midlands seats falling because of Brexit. But I can never get away from the suspicion that these vox pops are simply set up to tell a predetermined story: the Labour party is dead, Jeremy Corbyn is electoral kryptonite, the working classes' sole concern is immigration, and so on. It's too easy select vox pops to fit your narrative. As ever, the question will be _what really went on there?_, and we appear to be lacking in data this time round.
