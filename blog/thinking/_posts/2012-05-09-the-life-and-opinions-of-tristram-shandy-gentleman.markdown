> —'My sister, mayhap,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'does not choose to let a man come so near her....' Make this dash,—'tis an Aposiopesis,—Take the dash away, and write Backside,—'tis Bawdy.—Scratch Backside out, and put Cover'd way in, 'tis a Metaphor;—and, I dare say, as fortification ran so much in my uncle Toby's head, that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence,—that word was it.

[I was unfair to this book](https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster/status/209558856794243072). It was charming, witty, erudite and highly entertaining. Yes, it was quite long and I tired a bit in the middle, but that was work's rather than the book's fault. Written between 1759 and 1767, which is amazing, really.

I really should read <cite>Don Quixote</cite> soon.
