You could do very much worse than browse this [database of Krautrock reviews](http://www.wasistdas.co.uk/krautrockdata.htm) on a Sunday evening, read Julian Cope's [Krautrocksampler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrocksampler) or, best of all, listen to some Harmonia, Faust or Can. Unless you have work to do, of course.
