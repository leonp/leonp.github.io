On the theme of [circularity and time (and William Blake fans)](http://theother.leonpaternoster.com/paternoster-row) â€” there's lots of temporal playfulness in _Your Future, Our Clutter_, the 2010 Fall album.

As well as the slipping (floor) between songs and titles, there are some slight references to previous output; the sort of mid-line stuff you only pick up from 20 years of Fall listening:

* _Write it off! Write it off!_ from _Bury Pts. 1 + 3_ and _Words of Expectation_
* _95%_ from _Slippy Floor_ and _Hit the North_

Of course, there's a very faint Fall/Ackroyd coincidental pay-off in _Hit the North_'s Blake _London_ reference (_Manacled to the city!_), and both share an interest in the occult and timelessness. _Coaches and Horses_ is very Ackroyd.

I'd love to find a Paternoster reference in a Fall song (_Papal Visit,_ perhaps?), but nothing to report, I'm afraid.
