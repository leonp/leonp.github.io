title: How the Observer used dubious research and shoddy reporting to promote a Blairite Labour leader
category: politics
---

It’s Sunday, and <cite>the Observer</cite> has published a slew of [articles prediciting the death of the Labour party](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/19/corbyn-communist-labour-leader) should we not learn the correct lessons of the 2015 election defeat. Those lessons are:

- accept the Tory narrative on the economy to re-establish economic credibility
- [don’t vote for Jeremy Corbyn](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2015/jul/18/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-election)

I’m more than happy for <cite>the Observer</cite> to have an opinion on the future of the Labour party. I don’t agree with the general _vote Liz or have a Tory government until 2030_ argument, but I do agree that voting for Corbyn would be a disaster.

However, the paper seems to have willingly taken part in a campaign to promote a Blairite leader, blurring the line between reporting and editorial.

Facts are sacred and all that.

The lead story this morning was entitled <cite>[Labour’s lost voters may never return again, study finds](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/18/labour-party-voters-desertion-election)</cite>, a hair raising report into focus group interviews conducted in 5 marginal seats won by the Tories.

Aside from the less than convincing methodology and number crunching, [Toby Helm](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tobyhelm)’s report failed to disclose information about the company that conducted the research that would probably have cast the surveys in a different light.

A simple Google search reveals that:

- [BBM](http://www.campaignit.com/), the company that conducted the focus group interviews, is a political and corporate campaigning company, not a research company
- [BBM’s directors include Alan Barnard](http://www.campaignit.com/bbm-people/). Barnard was Tony Blair’s campaign and elections director.

So we have a pro-Blairite newspaper quoting a PR company headed by Tony Blair’s campaign director that produces research that backs the Blairite candidate for the Labour leadership.

You smell a rat too?

[I tweeted Toby Helm](https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster/status/622700191066554368) to ask him why he’d failed to mention BBM’s political background, and who’d commissioned the research in the first place.

He hasn’t replied, so I’ll outline what seems obvious:

Some group to the right of the Labour party hired BBM to campaign for a Blairite Labour leader. <cite>The Observer</cite> is taking part in this campaign by publishing editorial _and_ misleading reports into research that has an obvious bias towards the Labour party’s right wing.

Shoddy journalism, all in all.
