Just over four years ago -- and we should pause to reflect on _how the time passes_ -- I wrote a few (very enthusiastic) posts on a political idea that was gaining traction on the left and in web/tech circles; namely, [Basic Income](/2013/09/basic-income-examples/).

If you're unaware of the concept it's very simple. Instead of doling out complex, means tested benefits, the state would pay _every_ citizen a regular amount regardless of their employment status. In one fell swoop, we'd eradicate a punitive state bureaucracy and free ourselves from wage slavery and the fear of being restructured out of our job.

It sounds great, and these are, of course, noble aims. However, as the [idea has become more mainstream](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/25/scotland-universal-basic-income-councils-pilot-scheme) it has, unsurprisingly, attracted criticism as experts scrutinise it more closely. The UK's main UBI proponent published data that showed [how calamitous it would be to the poorest fifth of the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/27/green-party-citizens-income-policy-hits-poor). It's also also incredibly inefficient:

> Despite the fiscal effort that would go into implementing the new system — 6.5 percent of GDP, or nearly twice the share of GDP that the US currently spends on its military — the results are rather disappointing. Child poverty shrinks from 16 to 9 percent, but for working-age people it decreases less than 2 points (13.9 to 12 percent), and among pensioners it declines only 1 point (14.9 to 14.1 percent). The considerable sum of money mobilized has only a modest effect on poverty and doesn’t specifically benefit those who need it most. <cite>[The Case Against a Basic Income](https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/universal-basic-income-inequality-work)</cite>

There are better ways to make poor people less poor. However, what strikes me most now about the idea of UBI is how weak and _passive_ it seems within our system.
