Oddly enough, I've missed out on the [property owning democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/06/margaret-thatcher-britains-obsession-property-right-to-buy) (a strange conflation, no?) established by Thatcher in the 1980s. While friends' fathers (and it was always dads) bought up their council houses in the 1980s for about a quarter of their real value, we moved between rented houses paid for by my grandad or, when my mum moved in with an ex-public school boy, his dad's shitty rental.

There was no father in my life, so no owned house.

When I worked in London in the 1990s to the 2000s our Greenwich landlord offered us our [Cardoc Street](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Caradoc+St,+London+SE10+9AG/@51.4858782,0.0006793,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d8a827a8e72e83:0x41c9f43bbeda48dd!8m2!3d51.4858782!4d0.0028733) rental for &pound;180,000. We couldn't afford the deposit, and missed out on a property now worth around &pound;600,000. I know several London folk who sold up and bought very nice houses in Suffolk and Ipswich with the profits. <i>Sans</i> mortgage and rent.

Recently, I halfowned a house with a housing association on a crowded, non-designed, modern estate. By a stroke of luck I made a fair bit of money when I sold up earlier this year, but we still can't afford to buy. So I'm renting again.

Renting is horrible. Houses are invariably bodged up by landlords extracting the maximum amount of money for the minimum investment. Things fall apart regularly: ceilings, bathroom floors, handles, hot water, illfitting doors. Estate agents administer on behalf of the absent landlords, chucking tenants out who ask for things to be fixed, making use of a perfectly legal, two month "break" clause after a six month term. You'll be charged a checkout fee, tenancy fee, checkin fee, inventory fee and one and a half months' deposit. You'll pay a month's rent in advance. The estate agent will insist you steam clean the carpets, and get the oven professionally cleaned (probably by companies they insist on) when you leave the house. Moving costs around &pound;500, if you pack everything yourself. You'll lose a bit of your deposit too, because.

So the only rational answer to _rent or own?_ is own, because you won't be fleeced on a regular basis for the privilege of living somewhere. And your kids won't go through the same miserable experience.

But. What if rents were a sane amount, deposits reasonable and tenancies secure? What if your rented house would pass on to your children? What if your landlord fixed the property when things broke? What if your house wasn't owned by a private individual? What if you didn't have to deal with estate agents?

Then the question becomes one of _ownership_. I suspect lots of people want to own a property, but I'm not sure why. If you -- and your children -- don't have to worry about where you live and you don't exist to simply fund a private individual's wealth, why own a house?
