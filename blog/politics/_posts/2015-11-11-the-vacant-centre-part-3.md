One nation Conservatives. A rare breed in my lifetime, they're now all but extinct. So while the upper echelons of the Tory party are generally more socially liberal than they were 20-30 years ago, they're economically far more hawkish.

You don't have to be a Marxist to make a connection between the general economic situation of the country and the welfare of its citizens, as John Major notes:

> Everyone in receipt of benefits is not a scrounger. Of course idlers and scroungers exist â€“ and governments are entirely right to root out the cheats who rip off the taxpayer. But the focus must not be only on those who abuse the system; we need equal concentration on those who are failed by the system. <cite>['Shocking' inequality levels in Britain must be addressed, says John Major](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/john-major-blasts-shocking-inequality-levels-in-britain)</cite>

As we know, the centre has shifted. This is through a process of both redefining commonsense as it applies to _me_ rather than the country as a whole (I/we must pay off my debts), and allowing it to blindly dictate policy, even though [it makes absolutely no sense economically](http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/where-would-you-get-money-from.html).

I never fail to marvel at the [utter uselesness of the Labour party to redefine the centre](http://www.nobulbs.com/not-found-it-yet/); instead, it's left to former Liberal leaders, relatively sane Tories and John Major to knock the ball into a wholly empty net, while our Cruddases and Danczuks bang on about _social policy when there is no money around_.
