So, the good news: You can do a few kiosk tests and get really useful feedback. This is cheap, quick and relatively easy to do properly (although asking well-phrased, appropriate questions, setting the right mood and knowing when to keep quiet are skills that take some practice.)

The difficult bit: You need to test a few people often and _act on your test results_. Doing can be difficult, especially when you're not the person developing software. In fact, I'd say finding out how much testing and doing any contractor _really_ does should be a central part of any [request for proposal and tender process](/2017/02/functional-vs-user-testing/).
