Fixed headers are banners or navigation bars that stick to the top of the screen instead of disappearing when you scroll down the page. They've become more popular since the web moved onto mobile phones.

I think they're normally used for one of two reasons. On a long page, or on a screen that makes for lots of scrolling such as a phone, you could argue they make finding navigation easy: they're always available, wherever you are in the document. Secondly, they're quite whizzy. They break the normal convention of documents scrolling beyond the screen's borders, which perhaps _feels_ interesting.

In my opinion (no science here, I'm afraid) they're of limited use. Finding the top of a page is normally pretty easy regardless of how much you need to scroll; in return for this convenience you give up space for content.

This probably makes little difference if you're reading something on a screen. But if you're looking at an image you need as much page as possible the taller the image gets. And this isn't just a problem on mobile phones:

<p class="lh-title f6 mt0 c-secondary">Viewing category pages and close ups of clothes on the Uniqlo site is difficult because the fixed header restricts the available space. This means you can't see whole items.</p>

Lots of clothes websites use fixed headers, which is strange considering they need as much scrollable screen space as possible. And Uniqlo's is the worst I've come across, making the site largely unusable.
