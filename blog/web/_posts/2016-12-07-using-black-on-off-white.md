I'd changed the foreground/background combination on this site, which had been dark grey on white for eight years, mainly because I'd liked this piece on [how the web became unreadable](https://backchannel.com/how-the-web-became-unreadable-a781ddc711b6#.17po1hr1d), which argues that there's nothing wrong with a 'crisp' black on white for reading from a screen (and that true black isn't true black anyway). At the time of writing I'm `#000` on a creamy `#FFFCEB` (or [washed yellow, according to Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/)).

I'd also read something on the work site about how [readers with Irlen syndrome can find a white background stressful](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/parents-carers-and-children/dyslexia-irlen/).

The thing is, it seems _more_ people prefer dark gray on white to black on cream:

For instance, the color pair which was the fastest to read by the participants with dyslexia was black & creme&hellip; Luz Rello&#8212;<cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2012/text-customization/r11">Text Customization for Readability Online Symposium</a></cite>

And Marks himself appears to [argue for this combination](https://kevinmarks.github.io/textsamples.html). In other words, you can't get it right for everyone; instead, you're better off simply avoiding the obviously bad and erring towards what seems the more obviously good. Something dark on something light, a big font size (although some readers don't like it _too_ big).
