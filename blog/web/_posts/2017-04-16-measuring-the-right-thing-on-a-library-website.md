As ever, Gerry McGovern makes an important point on a Sunday afternoon:

> Digital must be measured based on customer outcomes. Traffic, visits, time spent, page views; these are not outcomes. [High traffic does not equal good customer experience](http://gerrymcgovern.com/high-traffic-does-not-equal-good-customer-experience/)

On our library site, _lowering_ the number of page visits and impressions is often our goal. For example, about 3 years ago Google started putting library opening times in the sidebar of results pages. As one of the most common customer tasks is to find out when the library is open, this was a good thing. It saved another click through to our website.

{% include figure.html url='haverhill-library-google-page.jpg' alt="Screenshot of a Google search for Haverhill Library" caption="Haverhill Library's google search page. The sidebar contains lots of information about the library." %}

Except Google often got the opening times wrong. So a part of our work is to manage library branches as Google businesses. That way we control opening times you see when you search for something like <i>Haverhill Library</i>, and we save you a visit to our website.

On the other hand, sometimes we do want to increase visits to our website, and the number of pages visitors browse. We publish lots of reviews and reading lists on the site, useful content we think customers could use for reading or even gift ideas. It's content that's just asking to be browsed.
