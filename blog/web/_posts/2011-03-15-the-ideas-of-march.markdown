Fittingly enough — given _Julius Caesar_'s fondness for long, declamatory speeches — [Chris Shiflett has asked us to write a blog post in praise of blog posts](http://shiflett.org/blog/2011/mar/ideas-of-march) and call it _The ideas of March_.

So why do I like blogs? Well, you can go on a bit, can't you? And Twitter without something to Tweet about would quickly eat itself.

But mainly because there are few better ways to disseminate ideas. Structure some text, images and video, add an informed commentary, and you've a rich, powerful medium. True, blogs often go unread, spam fills the comments section and authors get fed up (and turn to Twitter or, shudder, Tumblr), but there is still some [great](http://www.66000milesperhour.com/) [reading](http://blog.fawny.org/) [to be found](http://www.nextleft.org/) [out there](http://www.daccreative.co.uk/goodcopybadcopy/2011/03/10/twelve-more-words-to-ban-from-your-workplace/) [in](http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2011/nt-2011-03-14-Price-business.htm) [the big wide world](http://www.contrast.ie/blog/the-future-of-analytics-products/).

And you can't fit

> And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,<br>
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,<br>
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice<br>
Cry “Havoc,” and let slip the dogs of war;<br>
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<br>
With carrion men, groaning for burial. <cite>Julius Caesar</cite>
