title: Sketching pages with colleagues
category: web

We tried a new way of coming up with ideas for web pages today.

The normal process is:

1. A colleague tells us they want a new section on the website
2. They email various ideas and bits of text
3. We meet the colleague and agree what we're going to do
4. We (all 2 of us) start sketching

Today we were at stage 4 when I had the no doubt not entirely original idea of including the colleague:

<figure>

<img src="/images/board.jpg" alt="A board with a sketch on it">

<figcaption class="figcaption"><p>A website sketch, yesterday</p></figcaption>

</figure>

It worked really well. I reckon colleagues will feel a lot more involved while you can explain why your doing x and not doing y. Seeing what text and images you're planning on using, and how, will encourage colleagues to provide content, and you can design around anything they're already planning to provide.

You'll also save time and ill feeling in the future because when you present your first HTML page it won't be a _complete_ surprise.
