<p>I'm digital manager at <a href="https://suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a>. We're a small team with a smaller budget using a <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/what-really-matters-focusing-on-top-tasks">top task methodology</a>, card sorts and <a href="https://netlify.com">static hosting</a> to make our customer experience as fast and easy as we can.</p>

<p>I've managed not-for-profits' digital teams for eight years. If you're setting up a new team, or looking to review what you do at the moment, I can help. You'll find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/leonpaternoster">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/leonpaternoster">LinkedIn</a>, or you can email me at leon.paternoster@zoho.com</p>
