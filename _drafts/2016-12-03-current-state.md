I've been thinking recently about *how* I go about building websites, and how that methodology has changed over the years. If you could somehow measure how efficient that process has been, you'd plot a dramatically upwards chart. But there are downsides to becoming more efficient.

The big difference to 2007 is how *habitual* the process has become. Back then, I'd painstakingly style `divs` and the odd class, generating a rudimentarily structured stylesheet. Our main concern was separation of concerns, which basically meant using `float: left` instead of tables and removing any styles from our HTML. SMACSS, OOCSS and ITCSS were years off.

Around 2011 I started building mobile first. This was a (good) habit to get into, but only served to complicate my stylesheet. A year or so after that I began looking at external frameworks, which is the first major step to becoming more efficient. You basically let someone else write your CSS and think through class structure.
