I first built a proper website in 2006, a three page effort for a poet. I got drunk on the heady power of being able to mould text and pictures into something anyone could find by typing in a proper web address. It had a sidebar and was set in 16 pixel Georgia, which looked huge on an 800x600 monitor. Ahead of the curve, as ever &#8211; in 2006, most websites used 11px Arial.

Back then I wrestled with naked HTML and CSS, which was a wholly enjoyable experience. When I built a new website I'd start from scratch: the only thing it would have in common with my poet's effort would be `#content` and `#sidebar` IDs (which I'd merrily style). I'd use a bunch of completely new classes to build new page components, recycle nothing and construct gruesomely long selectors. This would result in several thousand lines of <del>repetitive CSS soup</del> handcrafted CSS.

A decade on and the process is quicker and more efficient: over time, I've developed better habits. Using the Tachyons framework for several months means coding takes little thought; the relationship between typing and seeing changes on the web page is as immediate and direct as it can get. It'd take me three or four hours to build the poet's website now, in 2006 it took several weekends.

Styling HTML has become an exercise in using APIs; in Tachyons' case, a terse, expressive and precise API. Our work is exponentially more efficient and repeatable, as any exercise in building interfaces should be. I could perhaps conclude it's not as much fun now, that we're not exploring CSS any more, but I don't think that's true.
