The latest update makes the following changes:



	
  * fixed bug where header text was displayed even if 'Display text' switch was set to 'no' in admin area

	
  * made whole header area a link to the home page

	
  * used `:last-child` to remove border from the last item in a nested list, thereby getting rid of ugly double borders

	
  * removed bottom padding from same list item

	
  * added a margin to the top of the page (`#wrapper` in style.css)

	
  * got rid of `hgroup` and `h2` descendant as per new HTML spec; replaced with `div` and `p` respectively

	
  * made header image scale with viewport


Update from your WordPress admin panel or [download from the themes directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo).
