Scherzo has been dragged into the modern world (note: it requires WordPress 3.x):



	
  * one widget ready, contextual sidebar

	
  * custom menu

	
  * custom background

	
  * excerpts

	
  * an _archives_ template that lists every post

	
  * rtl support

	
  * print style sheet




## Leon, what's a ‘contextual sidebar’?


Normally, WordPress theme sidebars appear on every single page of your site. Sometimes this is a good thing (when you put a search form in the sidebar, for example), sometimes it just makes for lots of noise. The Scherzo theme now has three sidebars that are displayed on particular pages:



	
  * _universal_—for widgets you want to appear everywhere

	
  * _front page_—for widgets you want to appear just on the front page

	
  * _single pages_—for widgets you want to appear on post pages




## Leon, it looks, erm, boring


You think so? I quite like it. Scherzo is purposefully vanilla, partly because some people like that ‘look’, partly because it supports rather than overpowers content, but mainly because people want a nearly blank canvas when using a theme out of the box.
