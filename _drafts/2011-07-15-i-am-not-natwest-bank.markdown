A while back I wrote a [throwaway post about my bank's website and its somewhat sexist imagery](http://leonpaternoster.com/2011/05/natwest-online-banking-with-a-smile/). It failed to create a tidal wave across Twitter.

However, it did garner a couple of responses (which I've removed):

It might seem quite comic that anyone could mistake my site for [Natwest](http://natwest.co.uk), but it also raises some interesting issues:



	
  * it's quite easy to get a high search engine ranking for a popular term. Often this post will appear on the front page of a Google search for _natwest online_.

	
  * lots of people don't get the basic structure of web sites, pages, URIs, logging in, blogs etc.

	
  * consequently people accept what they see on their screen as what they were searching for

	
  * people trust Google

	
  * the post uses the imagery from the Natwest website. Consistent imagery therefore perhaps creates trust

	
  * one of my recent _Natwest online_ search engine referrals visited seven pages, presumably in an effort to find something Natwest related. The illusion lasts.

	
  * phishing works




## What this means for people who make web pages


The web isn't simple for a lot of people.

If you're making something for a deep and broad audience you have to make sure it won't break. What appears to be self-evident probably isn't. Explain everything.
