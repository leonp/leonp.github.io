Most websites are built on a set of templates that control what content is displayed and when. For example, you'll use your home page, event and news templates to pull various bits of information from your website database to build standardised pages.





Every website will include a humble _content_ template for when editors need to write plain, one off pages. There are lots of pages built on a _content page_ template on the Suffolk Libraries website, including:







  * [A page about membership](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/about-us/ips-membership/)


  * [The about us page](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/about-us/)


  * [The jobs page](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/about-us/jobs/)





The editor's job is to structure the sometimes complex information on these pages so it's easy to understand, and he's (ahem) done well here by using:







  * headings to organise the information


  * short, active sentences


  * bullet point lists.





However, the website designer shares responsibility for making these pages readable as he or she controls _how_ these headings, paragraphs and lists are displayed. Editors have no control over this area.





## Basic heading typography is crucial





The humble content template occupies a somewhat unglamorous place in the template hierarchy. After all, an events template takes a lot of flashy work with time and repetition. It's more sexy.





Unfortunately, the designer often fails to give basic typography the same amount of thought. Take headings. The designer _should_ be considering lots of things when it comes to styling headings. Is he or she:







  * styling the full range of headings (`h1`-`h6`) and definition terms? Most CMSs don't allow editors to use the `section` element.


  * scaling headings to reinforce the heading hierarchy?


  * using colour properly?


  * considering proximity?





Proximity is especially important. Take another look at the [page about membership](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/about-us/ips-membership/) and you'll see that the second level headings are equidistant to the preceding and following paragraphs. This means the reader has to work to pair headings with their correct content.





Readers will find it even more difficult to interpret pages with lots of headings and short content sections. Take [the page about Ipswich County Library](http://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/libraries-and-mobiles/ipswich-county-library/). The event titles are correctly marked up in `h4` tags, but because they're only succeeded by a single line it becomes difficult for readers to attach the correct time to the correct event.





**A heading's top margin should be bigger than its bottom margin** to achieve meaning through proximity.





The Suffolk Libraries website is built on an attempt to maintain a strict vertical rhythm of 21 pixels, which goes to show that even apparently 'correct' approaches require some flexibility and subtelty.





## Help editors and readers





Typography is all about aiding meaning. Designers should help editors who take the time to mark up content correctly by supplying appropriate styles. Don't neglect the humble content template and its paragraphs, lists and headings.
