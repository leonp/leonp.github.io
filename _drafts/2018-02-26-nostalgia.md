I recently read a tweet advertising a 90s podcast, which promised a nostalgic look at the tropes and foibles of that decade in much the same way as programmes like <cite>Stranger Things</cite> and <cite>The Goldbergs</cite> do for the 1980s. I've also worked with someone who was "into 90s music", something I found very bizarre as I turned 18 in 1990 -- it wouldn't have occurred to me to be "into 60s music" at the time. Although I have to admit, like most things harmful to the nation's psyche, it was my generation who invented this recent-nostalgia craze, when we started banging on about the 80s and running 80s-themed events in student nightclubs, such as the truly horrible School Disco.

This recent-nostalgia is a bad thing for our spirit for many reasons, and you should resist it.

## Nostalgia historicises the past, which is OK for the 1650s but not for something that happened 25 years ago

The 1990s exist only as a period of time -- the 3652 days from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1999. They _mean_ nothing without the interpretation we used to reserve for historical periods. All historicising is falsification, which is fine for the more distant past as history is only meaningful in relation to the present. Our falsifications explain us in the same way our science fictions do. Recent events are a part of the present -- the more we historicise them the more we absolve ourselves of their motives and consequences.

## Makes us the victims of history rather than its agents

Similarly, if the 1980s and 1990s become known for a series of tropes (Norman Tebbit, on yer bike, low-quality, sub-Kraftwerk British pop, leggings, the Jane Fonda workout, the original New Balance trainers, Tony Blair, New Labour, Tracey Emin, new British cinema, Oasis, Oasis and Tony Blair and so on and on) we lose our agency in this recent history. Things were just like that and we lived _through_ these years rather than making a series of recent decisions and actions that have left us where we are now. Some people had to actually buy the first Oasis album (guilty, but not the second I can at least honestly state), vote uncritically for Blair and New Labour (ditto) and rave about Trainspotting and Shallow Grave (again, guilty).

## Nostalgia begets nostalgia

## Nostalgia blurs the important and the trivial

## History is horrible: nostalgia redeems history
