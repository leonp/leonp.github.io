In my last post I pondered a markup puzzle and suggested [a practical approach to using HTML5](http://leonpaternoster.com/2011/06/why-bother-with-html5-sectioning-elements/).

Since then the powers that be have decided we need a [task force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force) to decide [which meta standard should be officially adopted as part of the HTML spec](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdfa-wg/2011Jun/0058.html) (micordata or RDFa). Still thy beating heart.

## Leon's advice: Ignore and get on with your life


More talking about semantics and meaning, still no use.

However, people _are_ using microformats in the real world.

For example, WordPress generates microformated HTML out of the box (with the [hatom standard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom)) and readability has published a set of [author guidelines based on hnews](https://www.readability.com/publishers/guidelines/). This affects millions of websites.

Microformats are popular because they're simple to use and HTML version agnostic. They've been around a long time.


## A long way to go


All well and good. Most blogs out there use `hentry` and `fn` even if authors have no clue what they are.

But so what?

Without knowing what Google _et al_ do with this markup it's all guess work.
