[The Scherzo theme](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes/) is often described as _minimalist_, as in if you're looking for a minimalist WordPress theme, try _Scherzo_. It's not something I mind — after all, it's not a bad thing to be equated with [a popular shorthand term](http://www.google.com/search?q=minimalist+web+design) — but it got me thinking about what people really mean when they describe web designs as _minimal_ or _minimalist_.

## When people say they like minimalism often they don't mean it


[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="460" caption="Some minimalism yesterday. I think. (From http://www.minimalismi.com/2010/01/home-06-by-i29/)"]![Interior of a minimalist house: White, plain](http://www.minimalismi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lf-_-1-03551.jpg)[/caption]

By which I mean — people like the _look_ of spare, neutral unadorned stuff. I guess it implies wealth, taste and a certain smartness. However, people often don't like the design choices that are made in order to achieve a minimalist look — I get lots of requests for header images, inbuilt navigation and all kinds of other bits and bobs that would make Scherzo _look_less minimal.

(Incidentally, I don't mind these requests at all. I've never used the term _minimal_ to describe Scherzo; its only real purpose is to make reading blog posts easy, and there's always a balance to be struck between implementing genuinely useful features and achieving minimalism.)


## Good design is inherently minimalist


As it's nonsensical to design a web page, site or WordPress theme that _does_ any more than whatever its users want, [the term _minimalist_ is not particularly useful when it comes to describing web design](http://journal.drawar.com/d/minimalism-is-design-the-rest-is-just-art/). Designs are either good or bad; they either allow users to do what they're meant to do with a minimum of effort (=good), or they don't (=bad).

The term _unadorned_ is perhaps more meaningful. A design can be both effective (or minimalist) and _look_ florid or imperfect (as per some of the examples in [this article on Wabi-Sabi](http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/wabi-sabi/)). It can also look unadorned — the choice is part of whatever the designer is trying to communicate through the _form_ of the text. (—Or the limitations of the designer.)
