Gordon Ramsey _always_ gives failing restaurants the same vital piece of advice.

**Reduce** your menu.  Invariably, one of the main reasons that the restaurants he visits are failing (apart from clueless owners and chefs who don't know what a saucepan is) is their eagerness to cover every possible base when it comes to food.  Pizzas, kebabs, fish and chips and chicken on the same menu.  This may (just about) be acceptable at your local take away (no-one really expects these places to know how to cook a pizza properly, and they couldn't care less at 3AM on a Saturday morning), but not at a 'proper', sit down and pay, Â£20+ a head joint.

It shows that the owners don't know what they are for.  They don't have a clear idea of what their customers want, so they try and offer them everything they can think of.

And the same goes for websites.  Compare [this](http://google.com) with [this](http://yahoo.com) and you'll see what I mean.
