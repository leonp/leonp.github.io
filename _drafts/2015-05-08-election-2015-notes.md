Today was a bad day if, like me, you're a Labour party member or, more accurately, someone who doesn't like the Tories. Very bad. Here a few notes on what I make of it all. This could change, we'll see&hellip;

## Picking the wrong man

Labour lost by 99 seats and the Tories won an outright majority. You could no doubt ascribe this to lots of things, but you can't underestimate the Miliband factor.

I'll add the obligatory _I like the guy_, but at no doubt did I feel Ed convinced as a proper _leader_. A smart policy wrangler, principled etc. etc. but during the one TV debate I did watch he just struck me as someone trying to persuade me, the public, the man on the street that he had gravitas, heft, whatever. But he didn't, and he didn't look like he did. Consequently, he seemed a bit odd.

Cameron's no visionary, but he does at the very least appear capable and competent. With five years' experience under his belt he convinces as a prime minister.

It is worth bearing in mind that the parliamentary Labour party and its members &#8211; me included &#8211; voted for the other Miliband. The reason was quite simple, and very little to do with Brown and Blair, new and old Labour, left and right. I suspect I'm several degrees to the left of David Miliband, just like Dennis Skinner, who also backed him. After all, if you're not in the game you can't win, so [you pick the man most likely to beat Cameron](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/10/david-miliband-backing-dennis-skinner).

Instead, we got Ed on the back of a completely misguided union vote. We did loyalty well, but like a team doomed to relegation, we should perhaps have ditched Ed when it was clear he wasn't cutting the mustard.

Similarly, in Ipswich we chose local stalwart David Ellesmere over Jeremy Miles.
