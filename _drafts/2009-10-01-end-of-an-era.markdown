RIP Geocities:


> Dear Yahoo! UK & Ireland GeoCities customer,

We're writing to remind you that Yahoo! UK & Ireland GeoCities, our free web site building service and community, is closing on October 26, 2009.

We have enjoyed hosting web sites created by Yahoo! users all over the world, and we're proud of the community you've built. However, we have decided to focus on helping our customers explore and build relationships online in other ways.

On October 26, 2009, your GeoCities site will no longer appear on the Web, and you will no longer be able to access your GeoCities account and files.

What You Need to Do
If you're no longer using your web site, you don't need to do a thing, but if you'd like to move your web site, or save the images and other files you've posted online, you need to act now by downloading your files to your own computer.

To quickly download your published files and images, visit your GeoCities web site, right-click on each page, and choose Save Page As... from the menu that appears. Choose a location on your computer to save your files, then click OK or Save to save the HTML and images associated with your page. Learn more about downloading your files.

With your pages and images saved offline, you can re-create your site with any hosting provider you like, such as BT Web Hosting.

Please be aware that after October 26, your GeoCities files will be deleted from our servers, and will not be recoverable. If you'd like to save your files, you must download them now.

Another Way to Connect Online
As a Yahoo! customer, you can now use your Yahoo! profile as a central point to manage your identity, activities, and interests across Yahoo! and make it easy to connect and share with the people who matter to you most.

You can get started anytime by adding your picture and other personal details, then invite friends and family to connect â€” even start your own blog. You'll be able to follow the online activities of your connections across Yahoo!.

Setting up your profile is easy, and it's free! Visit your profile now.

Don't Wait
Please save your files now. If you need assistance, please visit the help centre.

We want to thank you for being a GeoCities customer, and hope you continue to enjoy our other Yahoo! UK & Ireland services.

Best regards,

The Yahoo! UK & Ireland GeoCities team
