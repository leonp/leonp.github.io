It's all well and good writing amusing error messages for when your visitors encounter a problem. I guess the idea is that something informal makes the error seem less machine like (and perhaps makes the visitor feel less culpable). Personally, I prefer [something human and factual](http://leonpaternoster.com/evfrvbgjhcvwejcvwjcvgwjcv). It's not really that funny when the computer messes up.

And the amusing approach really falls down when you encounter the error, oh, 20 times in one hour. If I see this screen again today I will destroy Flickr:
