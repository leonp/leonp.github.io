**As the eight or so people** who have subscribed to this blog over the last few years know, I make unerringly accurate predictions as to how web design will evolve. So when the whole world went mad over 36 column grid systems, I was pointing out that [grids are not an end in themselves](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/10/grids-great-but-use-with-care/). And when [the world's most read blogs were setting their body copy in 12 pixel verdana](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/24/a-small-study-of-big-blogs/) I was merrily using [20 pixel Georgia](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/05/supersize-your-site-big-text-sizes/).

This is an old story. And I am joking. Mostly.

But it's really good to see the rise of _apparent_ undesign. Blogs with one column and really big text are becoming the norm (see [iA](http://informationarchitects.net), [Zeldman](http://zeldman.com), [Drawar](http://drawar.com) and (ahem) [Fadeyev](http://fadeyev.net/)). I think it represents an increasing confidence in the medium. So instead of trying to make web pages look like newspapers we tend to concentrate on the important design stuff like readability across devices, our site's structure and user experience.

And sites look better as a result.

By a happy coincidence, we can now choose from a far wider range of typefaces than just two years ago. When we undesign a web page our typeface does a lot more work than it used to, so having something beyond Georgia or Lucida to reach for is a godsend.

Which brings me on to my current question. _Is there a sans serif font that can handle a one column blog?_ It's bugging me. I really want to use a huge [Meta Roman](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-web-pro) but I just can't get it looking right – it looks too spare and empty. Is there an alternative out there? Can you point me to an example?

It's not just that [serifs confer some sense of authority](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/responsive-typography-the-basics/). They seem to just _do_ more to fill the space one column leaves you – they say something about the text when you only have the text left.
