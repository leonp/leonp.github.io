**If we accept** that people don't click on ads then it's a waste of time trying to _sell_ on your website. You need to link to information about whatever it is you want your visitor to buy. And your links must not look like ads.

Easier said than done, perhaps. Think of all the exciting things you _could_ do to a link to make it look like an advert:



	
  * make an enlarged click area. It's a good thing if we can wrap block level elements in anchors because it makes for nice, big target areas. But if our links look like adverts it defeats the purpose.

	
  * use bright colours

	
  * use decorative images

	
  * make your links not look like links.


These aren't hard and fast rules – context is everything – but you see mistakes everywhere. Take the [HSBC home page](http://www.hsbc.co.uk):

[caption id="attachment_2573" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="More obscure images and links that aren't underlined."]![3 images that link to information and products](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/hsbc2.jpg)[/caption]

I'm willing to bet that the splash image and the three links beneath it get very little action. If you're looking for a mortgage or an ISA you'll head for the navigation menu rather than the picture of the vase and the armchair.

Finding out about savings and mortgages are common user tasks on a banking website. The products need clear navigation, not advertising.
