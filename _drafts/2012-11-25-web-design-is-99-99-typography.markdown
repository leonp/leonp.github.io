Came across an article that makes a seemingly bold claim: [_The responsive web will be 99.9% typography_](http://www.welcomebrand.co.uk/thoughts/the-responsive-web-will-be-99-9-typography/), which of course refers to iA's ground–breaking article [Web Design is 95% Typography](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/).

Why was it ever different? Or, to put it another way, what was web design before designers focused on typography and blocks of simple content that can be easily moved around?

Web design has gone through various fads over the years: image replacement, drop shadows, sliders, rounded corners, complex grids, all of which can _aid_ design to some degree, but are not ends in themselves. In other words, designers designed in order to achieve a certain technique or look, not to make readable pages that helped visitors do something easily. In fact, they weren't really designers. They were decorators.

There are probably several reasons for this calamitous error: the predominance of graphic designers turning their oar to web design, designers' expensive software and equipment, client ignorance of the new medium, designer ignorance of the new medium, lack of confidence in the web's technical possibilities and a desire to make the web do _more_ than boring old print.

But isn't it amazing how much time, money and effort it took to reach a self–evidently sensible stage where we can’t design something beyond applying the most simplistic layout?
