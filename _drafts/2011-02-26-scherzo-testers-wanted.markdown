I plan to release a big upgrade to the Scherzo theme in the next couple of weeks. Before I submit the theme to the WordPress directory I'd like to flatten any bugs. For that, I'll need some volunteer testers.


## What's in the new theme?


There are quite a few typographical changes, but the big stuff that really needs testing is:



	
  * custom header images

	
  * a responsive layout




## Feedback I'm looking for


First and foremost I want to know that these new features actually work. I've had one report of a bug with the custom header image already, although I can't say whether it's related to my theme or a corrupted WordPress install.

I'm now including javascript in theme rather than hotlinking to it. (The javascript is used to make IE recognise HTML5 elements and the CSS used to make the layout responsive). Does this cause any problems?

Secondly I'd like to know that everything looks OK. For example, are you happy with the layout on your preferred mobile device? Is the custom header image big enough?

Of course, _all_ feedback is welcome. I'm adding these features because of the comments, tweets and emails I've received from everyone out there.
