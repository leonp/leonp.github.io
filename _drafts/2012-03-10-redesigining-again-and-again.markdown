**I build a lot of WordPress themes.** --My blog is constantly changing, but its development has followed a decidedly non–linear pattern over the years. It goes like this:



	
  1. pare down the blog elements to the basics of what the reader wants, namely:

	
    * a navigation menu with an about page and a link to the Scherzo theme page

	
    * one column

	
    * links to next and previous posts

	
    * search box

	
    * Twitter and RSS




	
  2. get an idea about a layout, graphic, typeface etc. and try it out in a new design

	
  3. get bored of this design

	
  4. `goto` 1


I've rebuilt my site, tweaked menus, removed menus, added archive pages, removed category and tag links, added category and tag links and noted the corresponding visitor behaviour countless times. I know what my blog (and most blogs) need to the nth degree.

That's why messing around with your own site on a regular basis is a good thing. Not only do you get to try out an idea that'd be rejected in the real world (like [setting body copy to 20 pixels in 2008](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/05/supersize-your-site-big-text-sizes/)), but you get to know how to make something really _work_.__
