Why do people visit the Guardian's website? Because of [Polly Toynbee](http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/pollytoynbee), of course (and the excellent political judgement it routinely demonstrates). But—on a day to day basis, why do people end up on The Guardian's website and what do they want to do when they get there?

Here is a list of visitor scenarios, based on my own usage and, well, not much else really. In particular order:



	
  1. they've been directed to a story via a web link, Facebook, Twitter or email

	
  2. they've been searching for something specific and entered via a search engine link

	
  3. they come to the home page and initiate a search for something

	
  4. they want to find out about the major news story of the day

	
  5. they just want to browse the news

	
  6. they're interested in a particular section or collection of stories (e.g. football results)


I think that's a pretty reasonable list of scenarios. So, my next question is: Which of these home page designs best serves these user requirements?

Or:

And the answer is: _The mobile site_. Why? Well:



	
  * a simple navigation menu with just three choices means that readers 3 and 6 can easily find their way through the site to wherever they're heading. Desktop readers have a choice of 29 links on two levels in various beautiful colours to pick their way through

	
  * readers 1 and 2 can't do much more than read the story they've been directed to; there's no sidebar, no social media icons and no dating links—just a column of text and a choice of moving up the page or down the page

	
  * the first thing reader 4 will see is the lead story, and it's really obviously the lead story

	
  * reader 5 can browse up and down the mobile page for a _list_ of stories and articles. She starts at the top and proceeds to the bottom of the page. If there's nothing that interests her the choices are simple: Try a _section_ or a _search_. The poor desktop user has a choice of hundreds of stories across several columns: video, navigation lists, big, bright pictures. Lots and lots of _stuff_ to sort through: Too many decisions and routes through the content, too many competing stories


Of course, I'm simplifying somewhat: You could argue that the reader can go straight to the search box on the desktop site, whereas his mobile equivalent has to go via a search link. But there's clearly a much simpler path through the content on the mobile site.

I'd kind of given up on The Guardian after the [Lib Dem debacle](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/30/the-liberal-moment-has-come). But the new mobile site has got me browsing through it again. And here are two interesting things: I'll spend far longer on the mobile site reading more stories than I would on the desktop site, simply because it's easier to scan, navigate and actually _read_.

And that reading is done in a more traditional, print–like way, from the top of the story down to the bottom.
