Really good seeing lots of Scherzo downloads from the [WordPress themes directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo), and some feedback on my blog (a rating would be nice too, but heh).

I plan to take a little and often approach to improving the theme. In that spirit, the theme was updated to version 1.5 on 31 January; if you downloaded 1.4 you should get an automatic update from the directory.

[Download the Scherzo theme (v 1.5)  from the WordPress directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo).


## Changes from version 1.4:





	
  * functions.php no longer creates a custom menu area

	
  * added a unit to the line-height to create a better vertical rhythm

	
  * restyled lists so they’re no longer indented

	
  * restyled entry-content headings so they keep to the vertical rhythm (replaced margins on headings with padding so no margin collapse)

	
  * wrapped comments in a div rather than section to improve the document outline

	
  * resized comment area headings

	
  * changed sidebar line height to 18px (1.125em)

	
  * secondary text and sidebar body text changed to 13px (0.833em) Georgia


Future plans include a [built in responsive design](http://leonpaternoster.com/2010/10/notes-on-designing-for-mobile-phones-even-if-theyre-not-made-by-apple/). Any further requests/comments/bug reports etc. more than welcome.
