**Yesterday** I redid [my mum's theatre group's website](http://allsortzgroup.co.uk). I've been planning to build a one page site for a while and, partly inspired by [Kyle Meyer's post on long marketing pages](http://blog.kylemeyer.com/post/29653928420/why-the-build-2012-home-page-is-so-damn-long), I thought I'd give it a go.

The old site (which I was rather fond of as it was one of my first published efforts) followed an entirely standard home/about/contact page structure. It worked fine, but I felt it was lacking in detail and, as my mum's group has a story to tell, a one page makeover made sense.

I have to say I really enjoyed building this, and I think I'll be developing more one page sites in the future. Here's why:


## They're quick and easy to build


I reckon the HTML and CSS files took a grand total of 5 hours' work. True, there was no real research to do (I've worked on the site with the group for years), and my mum's the ideal client as she just lets me get on with it. But that's still quick.

It's not only fun working on one HTML file rather than a bunch of templates, it's easy. The site is mobile first and works perfectly in IE6+ (and even looks OK in IE5.5), but weighs in at just 269 lines of structured, one rule per line CSS.


## You concentrate on the content


As a one column, one page site is so easy to build, I found I concentrated more on the writing and basic typography (lists, images, headings etc.) The new site certainly reads better than the old one.

I also found I had to make sure the bread and butter information was easy to find. Of course, we should always make sure contact details are immediately available, but how often do we fall back on a separate contact page when most of your visitors just want to find out what you do and send you an email?


## The way ahead


If I was building sites for small businesses and one man bands, I'd definitely look at using a single page whenever possible.

From the developer's point of view one page is easy to build and manage, which also means customers pay less. Users benefit from a more focused design that works across all devices and browsers. There's Facebook, WordPress.com and Twitter for customer engagement.


## And that's your lot


At least for the time being. I start a new job on Monday and I won't be working on websites for the forseeable future (although you never know). Teaching doesn't leave much spare time.

I'll continue to update my Scherzo theme and I may blog about that, teaching and anything else that interests me. I suspect that'll include books, politics and maybe the web. It's more than likely that I'll move the blog to a subdomain.

I've loved blogging over the last four and a bit years, and if you have indulged my need to scratch the writing itch and read and commented on any of these posts, I thank you.
