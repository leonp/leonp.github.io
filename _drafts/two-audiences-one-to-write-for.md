title: Mission statements
---

Most new organisations, or those that have undergone some form of change, will reach a stage where they feel the need to write a mission statement. According to Wikipedia, a mission statement is:

> &hellip; a statement of the purpose of a company, organization or person, its reason for existing. The mission statement should guide the actions of the organization, spell out its overall goal, provide a path, and guide decision-making.

Which sounds more or less reasonable, although you may ask why an organisation feels the need to spell out what it’s for. Shouldn’t that be evident in what it does and the way it does it?

Anyway, I was involved in writing <a href="https://www.instituteofcustomerservice.com/453/Mission--Values.html">the Institute of Customer Service’s mission statement</a> (the Institute liked restructuring). We ended up with:

> The Institute of Customer Service is the first port of call on every aspect of customer service, delivering high quality tangible benefits to organisations, individuals and other stakeholders. As the professional body we are expert and independent; benchmarking and setting standards so that our customers can improve their customers’ experiences and their business performance.

Which isn’t too bad, I guess, if a little wordy and clumsy. The marketing and comms department batted around a few ideas before settling on this. My effort was something like:

> We help organisations improve their performance by training staff, benchmarking service and commissioning research.

which was dismissed as too plain and uninspiring (I prefer descriptive).

There are several problems with mission statements, beyond whether they're even necessary. Expressing why you do something honestly and plainly is difficult: you can end up betraying your insecurities.

Take another look at the Institute's statement. Why use the word _tangible_? Can a benefit be _intangible_? Let&apos;s say it can &#8211; who'd bother with _intangible_ benefits?

At the time, we'd commissioned a big piece of research into the return on investment of customer service, which we'd hope would _prove_ a link between investing in service (through, say, taking out an Institute membership) and getting a tangible benefit as a consequence (i.e. bigger profits). It was what we referred to as _the holy grail_.

It may seem evident that companies that provide good service keep their customers and therefore increase profits, but you could always counter that with <a href="http://customerthink.com/if_the_customer_experience_is_so_important_how_do_you_explain_the_success_of_ryanair/">the Ryan Air argument</a>. Having some form of proof was important to the Institute.

That's where the _tangible_ comes in. Essentially, it's a piece of marketing, an expression of how we wanted the world to be rather than how it necessarily was. And that's why I prefer my effort: it did at least keep to the facts.

## Who's the mission statement for?

The Institute example is intended for potential customers: it's a piece of sales material which sits on a website or poster, or in a brochure. That's all well and good, but I doubt customers want to know the whys and wherefores of your existence over how your product or service will help them. If your philosophy or ethics are an important part of that product or service, then you should be detailing exactly how you do things. That's why Twinings tells you about founding the ethical tea partnership on the side of their English Breakfast tea packet, rather than saying something like:

> We provide top quality tea while ensuring its producers are given a fair deal.

The most important audience for a mission statement is really staff, and I can see how coming up with a paragraph could be a useful exercise in making decisions and concentrating on certain areas over others. Being able to sum up what you do in a sentence _is_ a useful skill.

If we allow mission statements can be of some use, we need to take care over our words &#8211; I've seen a couple slip into jargonised management speak. I can't imagine they had much effect on staff beyond the odd shrug, snigger or raised eyebrow.

Management seems to find writing difficult. Rather than express a goal in plain, understandable English, it's easy to reach for a buzz phrase to impress important people. That may do your career good, but it'll mangle your syntax, and leave your staff bemused.
