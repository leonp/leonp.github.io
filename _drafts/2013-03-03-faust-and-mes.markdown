The oddities you notice over time. Here's an image from the vinyl cover of The Fall's [Bend Sinister](http://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/1087698/Bend-Sinister/Product.html) LP (the title's nicked from one of Nabokov's first novels in English):

Now, I'd always assumed The Fall had commissioned this image, because one of the people in it looks like Mark E Smith:

There's a song on Bend Sinister called Dk. Faustus. And it turns out that the image is actually from the first edition of Goethe'sÂ Faust. Which is slightly odd, no?
