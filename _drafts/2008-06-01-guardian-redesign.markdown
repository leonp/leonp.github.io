I occasionally attempt site redesigns in order to try and improve my CSS and design skills.  I thought I'd have a go at redesigning [The Guardian](http://guardian.co.uk)'s website; partly because it's my home page and partly because it has a few design problems that require quite a lot of thought.

This is a work in progress: I'd like to try a more fundamental redesign of the site's information architecture (perhaps swapping the placement of the 'serious' and 'interactive' sections).    For the moment, I've tried to address the following problems:



	
  * a header that's way too busy - the search function isn't clear enough

	
  * the confusing use of colour in the navbar

	
  * too much information on the screen, resulting in

	
  * white space issues

	
  * [griditis](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/05/why-use-grids/)


The basic approach is to simplify the top level navigation so that users are encouraged to click through to sections rather than search for relevant information on the home page.  There are a couple of immediate issues that need tackling: For one, there's rather a lot of empty space in the right hand column - do I expand the current contents or add some sort of news directory?
