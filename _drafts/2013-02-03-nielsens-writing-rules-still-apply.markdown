Is there really a web “demographic” out there that demands more than a [Nielsen–like, keep it brief approach](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/) to long form texts on the web? That's the [question raised by James Brock of Addison](http://www.addison.co.uk/the-round-table/does-one-size-really-fit-all), a “leading corporate communications agency”.

This sort of article appeals to our desire for more depth in writing. Or, if we were feeling a little more snobbish, a desire for “proper” writing that takes some proper thought to interpret.


## Newspaper articles don't really prove anything


I'm not sure I agree with James' reasoning. Firstly, he argues that because newspapers and magazines publish the same text in print and online, there's an audience for a differently formatted, longer form of writing:


> …you actually end up reading exactly the same content, with the points and arguments developed just as they are in print.

Given the speed with which ‘serious’ publications have embraced digital publishing, then it seems safe to assume there’s a sizeable web demographic that’s happy with this approach.


We could question whether “serious” publications have really embraced digital publishing. We could also question the assumption they publish the same content on and offline for any other reason than it's quicker and cheaper than drafting separate article versions. And more importantly, we could question whether the conventions of print and Nielsen's rules are really that different.

Take a look at any broadsheet newspaper article and you'll notice lots of single thought/sentence paragraphs and the [inverted pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid):

The point is that unless you're writing a novel or a poem, good writing is easy to understand writing, regardless of the medium. Expressing “complex thoughts” in an accessible way is an invaluable skill.


## e-readers don't equal reading from the web


James' second argument is based on the popularity of e-readers:


> Maybe the accelerated growth of e-readers provides another form of evidence that our current assumptions about presenting content digitally need to develop further. After all, even the Kindle version of Fifty Shades of Grey hasn’t yet adopted the picture / bullet point / key-word-picked-out-in-bold approach.


The problem here is that James has shifted from the web to the offline world. Nielsen's rules are based on using a web browser to read various things on websites, a scenario which presents a range of problems for longer form texts (apologies for the bullet point list):



	
  * Screen glare

	
  * Poor quality web design

	
  * Reader impatience

	
  * Fixed screen position


Browsing the web is different from reading Anna Karenina on a Kindle, an experience closer to reading an old fashioned book. The Kindle's screen doesn't glare, you can lounge on a sofa and move the screen around and there's nothing to distract you from the text.


## Nielsen writing is good writing


The web allows us to publish thoughtful articles to millions of people. By following a few simple rules, we can make even the most complex thoughts accessible to our readers. That's what makes for good writing.
