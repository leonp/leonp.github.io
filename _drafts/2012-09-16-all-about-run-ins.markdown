_You'll come across first line run-ins_ at the start of an article or a chapter of a book. They're not particularly spectacular: just a few words set in [small caps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps) (or faux small caps, depending on the typeface you're using).





They signpost a new part of the text, prompting the reader to refocus. If you're reading a novel out loud you might voice a run-in slightly more distinctly than normal. English teachers use them to get students concentrating again.





In print and on screen they provide a little visual variation. Traditionally, we would've used a `span` to style a run-in, but since the `b` and `i` elements were refactored we can do this a bit more 'semantically'. I guess you could make a case for using `b`, but I've plumped for `i`:

> The i element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.
