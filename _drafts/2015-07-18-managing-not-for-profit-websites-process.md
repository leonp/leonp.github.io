How do you decide what to build online and when?

Who's responsible for building websites in your organisation? How do you keep online information up to date and relevant?

What is your website for?

Web managers answer these questions. If they know what they're doing and they're given resources and the power to make decisions they can help organisations save money, attract new customers and develop new business.

I've managed not-for-profit websites for 6 years. The one thing that's been common to all of them is that there's not much money around. So I've developed a 3 stage web management process that's simple to understand and implement, which means you don't need to hire expensive consultants to do the work.

That does mean you need a web manager with a broad range of skills and an understanding of how the web works and how people think when they go online. If you're hiring a web manager, this article will help you think about what to look for in her.

For web managers looking for a starting point or a different perspective of what their job involves, here's my process:

## 1. The research stage

When you begin managing a website you'll need to find out two things:

1. What your customers want from your website
2. What your organisation wants from your website

There may or may not be a tension between these two audiences. If you're lucky your organisation has aligned its objectives with its customers. If you're unlucky your job will be tougher. Look at it as an opportunity to get your organisation thinking in a different, better way.

Your first loyalty is to the customers.

### Content audit

The first thing you should carry out is a content audit. This'll help you:

- get a handle on what your organisation does
- understand what content your customers are interested in
- understand what content your customers probably aren't interested in
- make some quick, cheap improvements to the website

### Stakeholder interviews

Staff will help you understand where your website is failing and its potential. They'll also reveal its history &#8211; there's always interesting history in a website. You'll also want to find out:

- the mood and tone you want to convey to customers, which will give you some sort of design starting point
- what audiences you currently serve
- what audiences you might want to target

Stakeholder interviews get your colleagues involved in the whole web management process, which builds credibility and makes it easier to change things in the future.

### Top task research

The audit forms the basis of top task research. You'll need to assemble a list of all the tasks you _could_ perform on your website and get customers to vote on their top 5. Creating the list can take some time. Use these sources:

- _Your content audit_ lists all the things you can do at the moment
- _Stakeholder interviews_ &#8211; staff and colleagues will have ideas on other things your customers might want to do. You'll also get buy in if you involve them in the process (include a broad range of roles, from board members and senior management to frontline staff)
- _Customers_ &#8211; ask them (either in person or via a form) what they'd like to do on your website
- _Competitor analysis_ &#8211; take a look at some competitor websites and make a note of the stuff they do

Once you have a task list get customers to vote on what's important to them. You can then make a league table of tasks, which will prove invaluable in the future:

- You'll have an objective reason for developing new features
- You'll have an objective reason for removing existing features
- You can make design decisions based on your findings

### Card sort

Ask customers to group and label the tasks you presented in your top task research. You can do this in person, or you can use an online service such as Optimal Sort. Bear in mind the average person often has an idiosyncratic view of the world, and will label things in apparently illogical ways. You'll need to interpret the results. Once you've worked out your website's _taxonomy_ you can:

- structure your website's content
- label navigation items
- explain why you've used certain words to describe what the organisation does

There are no doubt many other ways to research your website requirements. These steps can be carried out simply and cheaply. You just need to get access to a broad range of colleagues and real customers.

## 2. Write a strategy

All this information forms the basis of your digital strategy, a document that'll serve as your bible and, ultimately, your justification for doing things.

Becuase digital changes so quickly you'll probably only set out some short term strategies for achieving your organisation's digital goals. The strategy serves several other important functions. It should:

- establish content provider and editor roles
- set out policies for areas such as social media, writing style and accessibility
- establish what digital services you should have the final say over
- determine how you integrate external services into the website
- outline your current and target audiences
- provide several different ways forward (most likely according to the budget you can get)

A strategy is a useful document in and of itself, but it's really important you make it _official_. To that end, get it approved by senior management and your board.

Digital is an amorphous area; teams have budgets with which to buy web services and colleagues will too often see your role as purely technical. Don't be surprised when you're simply asked to implement things other people can't, down to shifting pixels. Remember, you've carried out the research and you have the digital expertise: anything you put online is your responsibility, and that means saying _no_ quite a lot.

You'll find it hard to make sure the web works in the way you want. A digital strategy will help you immeasurably.

## 3. Design, test and implement

Your strategy will outline what you want to do over the next few months and why. Now's the time to start doing it.

Obviously, budget is important here. You may have been hired partly for your technical skills: you can use CSS, HTML and a bit of javascript, or you've been keeping up with various frameworks. You know your Nielsens, McGoverns and Frosts. In other words, you can probably build a decent website, and that will save your employer thousands of pounds a year. Never underestimate the technical skills.

If you're doing the work you have lots of information that will inform your website design. Knowing your top tasks makes your home page design easier, while the card sort will determine your IA.

Can you afford to hire someone who can design a logo? Do you need help with type or colour? Background colours? Tone? Do you need a graphic designer?

The important thing is to present _something_, be it paper sketches, prototypes or HTML pages for testing. Testing needn't be a time consuming, expensive process.

### Kiosk testing

If you're coding, which platform do you use? The most obvious answer to this question is WordPress: it's free, has fantastic support and a million and one plugins for things like events
