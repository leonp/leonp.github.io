You didn't ask me, but I'll tell you anyway. Within organisations there are two great barriers to communication between colleagues:



	
  1. The use of jargon and acronyms. Sometimes, even names are reduced to three letter codes. While there is a perfectly understandable reason for this, it makes things VDI.

	
  2. The assumption that the person you are addressing knows what project/acronym/abbreviation you're talking about. If you haven't been working somewhere very long (and even if you have) it's NVS if you don't provide aÂ _little_ explanation.


ITY.
  *[VDI]: Very Difficult Indeed
  *[NVS]: Not Very Sensible
  *[ITY]: I Thank You
