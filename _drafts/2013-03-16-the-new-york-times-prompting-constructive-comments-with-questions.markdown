As part of its ongoing redesign the New York Times is changing its comments system. What's particularly interesting is how [it asks visitors questions about the article they've just read](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/cardinals-elect-new-pope.html), rather than present them with a blank _Add a reply_ form.

If we're looking for a comment to a blog post we'll often end on a question. The NYT has developed this idea; a very smart move that I think will bring several benefits:



	
  * Setting a word limit makes respondents think about their answer.

	
  * More people will respond to the article as it doesn't take much effort to click on a square or answer a direct question.

	
  * The paper can steer responses down constructive routes. Blank comment forms often attract rants.

	
  * Similarly, readers can sort comments more easily.

	
  * It'll collect lots of interesting data it can use to interpret reaction to a story. In turn, it'll be able to add this data to its reporting.


This is one of those ideas that just seems _right_. After all, a constructive conversation rarely starts with _And what do you think?_Â There's even something hostile in asking such a blunt question.

As teachers know, there's an art in getting students to respond appropriately and intelligently to something they watch or read. The New York Times is making a radical change in how respected publications invite a response from their readers.
