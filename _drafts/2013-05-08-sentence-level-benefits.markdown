Good copy tells readers how something will benefit them, rather than the ins and outs of using it.

Apply this knowledge whenever you're updating web pages and you'll make your meaning clearer.

Here's an example of a sentence I changed today. It describes a service:


> Information about support and services to help you get on with your life and keep your independence, and a place to store what you have found in an account for future reference.


Not too bad, but a bit flabby. Applying our _benefits, not ins and outs_ theory we can strip out the stuff about the account, and tighten up the grammar while we're at it:


> Support and services information to help you get on with your life and keep your independence. You can store what you find for future reference.


We've saved seven words and the effort required to interpret a 32 word sentence made up of two long clauses. And we've made it clear why you should take a look at this service.

I really like this low level work. It's not sexy and it'll get you very little credit from your colleagues. It's also hard to measure its impact. But you're probably making a reader's life a little easier.
