Incredible, really. A seemingly impenetrable account of a Dublin day. Often the narrative becomes unfollowable as the voice changes mid sentence. Sentences lose traditional grammar, becoming fragments. New compound nouns (_scrotumtightening_, _laceflicker_). Allusive, repetitive and subtle to the nth degree. Very, very funny.

The world assembled subjectively, through thought and its relationship to language.
