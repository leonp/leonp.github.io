I've reinstalled comments on my blog.

There's not really any reason not to have comments. If I'm being honest, I haven't included them for a while because:



	
  * they're a pain to code and style

	
  * they look messy.


These are rubbish reasons. I don't have to worry about spam or trolling. My commentators were always very civilised.

A blog should invite comments. Twitter is pretty poor for any form of detailed discussion. And, if you're worried about these sort of things, they're great for reader engagement.

Now, the problem I have is that the last 50 or so posts don't have comments. And if there's anything that puts readers off adding a comment it's seeing that no-one else has left a comment anywhere.

So, erm, what do you think?
