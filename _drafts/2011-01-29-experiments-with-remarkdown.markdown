ReMarkdown is basically a CSS stylesheet that makes your document look like [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). You'd normally use Markdown to generate HTML without the hassle of using tags, but the look is quite distinctive and appropriate for certain types of writing (about programming, for example). Alternatively, you could use ReMarkdown to make a lo-fi statement.

It was created by Florent Verschelde, and you can [read more on his website](http://covertprestige.info/css/remarkdown/). I thought a WordPress theme based on ReMarkdown would look quite cool and -- important this -- be really easy to get up and running.

The process was pretty simple. I took [my Scherzo theme](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo), replaced  its stylesheet with ReMarkdown, added a few input styles and made the `small` element bigger. About 30 minutes work in all.

ReMarkdown for WordPress works, but it needs a bit more. There are no `table` styles, for instance. I'm debating whether to continue creating the theme…
