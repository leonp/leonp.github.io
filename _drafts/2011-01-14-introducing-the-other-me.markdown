I normally hate these introductory posts (actually, I always hate these introductory posts), so I'll be quick.

This is my other blog. I'm Leon Paternoster and [I've been wrtiting about “reading, writing and designing web texts”](http://leonpaternoster.com) for nearly three years now, probably because I'm interested in things like HTML, web typography and writing. I work as a website editor.

However, I'm also interested in the world beyond web texts and, as I like writing, I've been thinking of ways of writing about reading, politics and all sorts of other unconnected things. After starting to build a couple of WordPress themes I got bored, so I decided to install a ready made theme and start writing.

And here we are. To quote 80s Level 9 text adventures:

What next?
