title: The problem with procurement
---

A propos of Gerry McGovern's article <cite>What the HealthCare.gov fiasco teaches us<cite>, which begs the question *what makes for a good procurement process?*

There are two sides to procurement, the person (or people) doing the procuring and the agency they choose to do the work. If you don't get both right you have problems.
