**Your website words are important.** All the sweat, money and tears may be spent on design, templating and technical jiggeryâ€“pokery, but ultimately it's your copy that get results.

So it makes sense to spend money on your words. Yes, everyone _can_ write, but few people can write well.

But let's say you are writing your own copy.

There's one thing you absolutely must do. Forget tone of voice, chunking and paragraph length.

Before all that _get someone to read your words_.

Not someone who knows what you do.

See how they respond to the text. Then ask them if it made sense.

And then rewrite.
