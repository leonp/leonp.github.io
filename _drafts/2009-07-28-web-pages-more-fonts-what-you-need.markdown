The web’s abuzz with [talk of expanding the range of fonts](http://ilovetypography.com/2009/07/20/web-fonts-%E2%80%94-where-are-we/) we can use in web pages.

Apparently, this is important. This is something we want. [Designers often throw their hands up, exasperated](http://unitinteractive.com/blog/2009/04/22/why-is-the-web-great-for-everything-except-fonts/), at how difficult it is to use, say, [Caslon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caslon) for headlines.

And yet…how often do you actually encounter this frustration? Not just as a designer, but in _normal_ web life. Yes, it might be _really_ good to be able to use [Meta Sans](http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_meta_serif_sans_ot_complete_suite/) because that's what the corporate brochure is set in. But I bet it’s more of a concern that [an optician uses tiny text and a light grey on a white background](http://www.visionexpress.com/).

Perhaps, as Joe Clark says, [there is no broad clamour among web designers to use any font they want](http://blog.fawny.org/2008/07/22/billhillsite/).

What do annoy are the same old bugbears: crap layouts, unreadable text, stupid “features”, Flash abuse, unnavigable IA, MMN etc. etc. With a handful of fonts, most of which have been designed to be read from a screen (—even at small sizes) we still get the basics wrong. Take this [CSS expert's blog](http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog). Can you spot the links? And just a few months ago the body copy itself was bolded in order to make it readable.

But the [Skolar](http://ilovetypography.com/skolar-typeface-by-david-brezina/) does indeed look lovely.

There are even advantages to using a handful of _safe_ web fonts — it reduces the chances of making a mistake. Clients can’t ask for a completely inappropriate font for their site’s body copy because that’s what they use in their print material. It’s _fun_ working within a tight set of rules.

### Font stacks aren’t all bad


I'm certainly not against being able to use more über fonts in web pages: I guess I agree with [Mark Pilgrim on this](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/04/21/fuck-the-foundries). Instead of worrying about the licensing perhaps we _should _use free fonts like <del>Skolar</del> [Calluna](http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna/regular/) — or even stick to font stacks. That way the great unwashed get Arial while all your designer friends can revel in [Gotham](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=%20%20%20%20100008).
