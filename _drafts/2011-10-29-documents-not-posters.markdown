**Try marking up a normal document.** Something like a help page, set of instructions or an essay. Easy, isn't it? `article`, `section` and `figure` all come naturally--no semantic wrangling required. This is how the web must have been in the late 90s. Not now, of course. So--what (if anything) needs to change? The markup language, the idea of markup itself or the way we _write_ web pages?
