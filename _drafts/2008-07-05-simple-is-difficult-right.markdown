Many commentators extoll the virtues of **simplicity**.  It's a truism that simple design is better than complicated design (but not complex design: 'complex' is 'complicated''s semantically acceptable cousin; perhaps 'complex' is also distantly related to 'simple'?).  The central tenet of my own design (reduce and simplify) is derived from my own experience of using complicated sites: I have an almost physical aversion to complicated architectures, long lists of links, widgets, tiny font sizes, pointless splash screens and any place in which the **graphic designer** has held sway.  I'm grateful for [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108).


### Good design


On the other hand, I breathe easy in the presence of simple, **large** design.  It suggests both confidence on the designer's part and a respect for the reader.  I actually enjoy navigating and reading sites such as [Jon Tan](http://jontangerine.com)'s. [Monday by Noon](http://mondaybynoon.com/)'s redesign is fantastic.  My needs are simple: a few navigation links and large, well-spaced text do it for me.

Yet this simplicity appears to be difficult to attain.  Why do so many apparently talented designers produce work that is so unnecessarily **complicated**?  There are two main reasons, I think.  The first is the victory of the evil graphic designer, the second the amount of effort it requires to master CSS (and yes, the two are linked).


### CSS is simple!


CSS is not complicated per se.  This makes sense to the unitiated:

    
    <code>font-size: large;
    font-family: georgia;
    color: black;</code>


but it does become complicated when we try and cludge CSS into ever more contorted shapes. Containers, wrappers, multi-column layouts, fantastical grids, multiple background images take a long time to master, and, as is the case when we master any difficult skill, we develop a sense of confidence and control as we become more proficient.  **Complicatedness** therefore begets more complicatedness: the 'good' designers are those who have mastered the most difficult techniques.


### What next?


So as I think about a site **redesign** (and why do I think about a 'redesign' before rethinking my content?), I want to simplify further.  My home page has two columns.  Why?  Was it simply because I was reading [some gubbins about 'golden ratios'](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/29/applying-divine-proportion-to-web-design/) as I designed it?  Probably.  The next will have just one column throughout. **Reduce and simplify**.
