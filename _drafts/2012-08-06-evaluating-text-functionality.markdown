**All texts** communicate in two ways. Firstly, they inform, entertain or persuade – they serve a _functional_ purpose. Secondly, they tell us something about the text's subject or author through indirect signs, such as imagery, vocabulary and choice of typeface. For want of a better term, we could label this the text's _metaphysical_ purpose. Even the simplest, trashiest novel is more than a series of entertaining events in the hands of the right reader.

There is much ironic fun to be had playing with purpose, and the distinction between the functional and the metaphysical can become blurred. Things that please us metaphysically are often easier to use, while a functionally effective object can become a pleasure to use. Texts can happily do two (or more) things at once. Think of a poster for a gig. Its functional purpose is to tell the reader when, where and how much the event is. At the same time, it will communicate something about the band itself, so that fans connect with the band through the use of certain symbols, images and even typeface.

But there are times when we don't want to be ironic, when a text's purpose is _almost_ entirely functional. Road and airport signage needn't tell us much about a government agency, apart from how competent it is. I say _almost_. When I see Meta Sans used for council signage here in Ipswich it creates a certain frisson as it's so suggestive of Europe (and yes, I am aware Ipswich is in Europe).

## Web texts are mostly functional


This functional/metaphysical distinction is really a continuum. Texts will fall nearer one end than the other. In fact, exactly where they fall will often depend on the reader: Literature courses encourage us to examine the metaphysical purpose of a text (as I say, more sophisticated readers can tease metaphysical meanings from the trashiest of novels).

However, web documents are largely functional and in this sense web design is like engineering. Readers don't approach web pages searching for meaning; they generally want to _do_ something or find information that will enable them to do something. There are exceptions, of course. A designer's website will need to say something about the designer and her ‘style’, but even then its primary purpose is to help the reader contact her and see the work she's done.

Yet the discourse about web texts is often rooted in the appearance of a thing (it looks nice, it looks minimal etc. etc.) rather than its functionality. [Most dribbble comments follow this pattern](http://dribbble.com/shots/675721-Dark-Map-data), mainly because shots are _pictures_ of working, functional things. They encourage comments about the _feel_ of a text rather than how well it works.

Feel and emotion are important, but they're secondary to function on the web. It's impossible to gauge how something will feel if we don't know how it works.
