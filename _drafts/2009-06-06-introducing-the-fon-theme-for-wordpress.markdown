A simple, readable theme for WordPress:



	
  * [Download the theme](http://www.box.net/shared/zq9r625r5x) (fon.zip, 70K)

	
  * [View the live demo](http://leonpaternoster.com/fon)


Feel free to modify or use for any purpose, but please keep the footer link to my website in tact. This theme is released under the terms of the [GPL license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php).


## Installation


Install in the normal way, i.e. extract the fon.zip file and upload it to your themes folder. Login to your dashboard and select the theme from the _Appearance_ menu.

This is an early version of my TTP theme. I've tested it across all browsers except IE6, and it works well; however, I can't accept any responsibility for any problems it may cause you.

You can add widgets to the sidebar.

Please feel free to leave any comments, bugs etc.
