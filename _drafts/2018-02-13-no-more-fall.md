The first Fall album I bought was 1990's <cite>Extricate</cite>. It had a beautiful, black cover with an Anthony Frost painting on the front. On the back, the band posed, Mark E Smith diffident, distant and not quite insouciant, Marcia Schofield glamorous in the extreme and Martin Bramah -- a founding member I'd later learn -- in a gold lamÃ© shirt. This was the start of the Phonogram years; relatively poppy, according to some, although utterly different to anything else to my ears. Mark was still relatively healthy and often wore a leather jacket, white shirt and smart trousers. He looked a bit like a policeman. Brix had just left the band. I'd learn of Brix later, but she also meant very little to me.

We liked The Fall; it defined my group of friends and marked us out as different. Cleverer, classier, better. Oddly enough, considering my later (and this is absolutely not an exaggeration) _obsession_ with the band and Mark, I _quite_ liked Extricate when I first bought it. It was only when the follow up _Shiftwork_ came out that I bought it on the very day of release, and spent the next few days lapping up every precious song for weeks on end. We went to see the band whenever they played Norwich, Colchester, Cambridge or London. They never came to Ipswich.
