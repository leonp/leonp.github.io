Removing unnecessary content from a website will do you and your users a favour. Asking *Does anyone else do this better?* can help you streamline your content.

If you&#8217;re managing a public service website (which I am), Gov UK&#8217;s [Design Principles][1] are your bible. They cover areas such as user research, design and content strategy.

When I started to improve the Suffolk Libraries website, the first things I did were:

*   [A content audit][2]
*   Find out the tasks our users wanted to perform on the site, following [Gerry McGovern&#8217;s top task methodology][3].

McGovern&#8217;s guidelines provide a step by step guide to structuring a website, starting from gathering information to producing an IA.

But I wish I&#8217;d also referred more to GDP #1 *Start with needs*, especially [the notes on scope][4], which you could apply to your task list by replacing *government* with the name of your organisation.

*Can only Suffolk Libraries meet this need?* â€“ I neglected this question, which was a mistake. You might unearth a popular, current website task, but that doesn&#8217;t mean your users have (or want) to do it on *your* website.

If I&#8217;d have asked this question of one particular task, I could have saved myself a lot of unnecessary development work and future checking and updating.

After several years of poor management, websites tend to accumulate lots of pages that seemed useful or worthy at the time, but in fact served little value because users could go to Google for the service.

As a rule of thumb, getting rid of these types of pages is good for you and your website users, because:

*   your users have less content to navigate so they can find the page they need more quickly
*   you can concentrate on fewer, more important pages

## Removing content can be tricky

Of course, the more content you want to remove from a website, the more difficult conversations you&#8217;re going to have. Often, web content is a visible output of some form of *work*, regardless of how useful that content is.

But that&#8217;s for a separate post.
