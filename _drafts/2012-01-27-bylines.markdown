Part of my job involves scanning and filtering _lots_ of articles in news feeds.

I use Google Reader to collate all my Google News and Blog searches. It's a really good system that generates a long list of articles that match various search terms.

So if you're trying to catch my attention one thing you'll need to do is write a good headline (more of which later, although the Baymard Institute has written [a post on constructing eye catching headlines](http://baymard.com/blog/copywriting-useful-yet-intriguing-headlines) that'll keep you entertained in the meantime).

The other thing you'll need to do is establish some form of credibility or trust. And one of the quickest ways of doing that is by putting a real name to your article.

There's nothing more suggestive of a robot churning out content than an _Admin_ byline:

[caption id="attachment_2468" align="aligncenter" width="668" caption="A Google Reader snippet. Lots of information here that I can use to evaluate the article. The headline is good, but the byline indicates this was written by a machine."]![Screenshot of a Google Reader snippet](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/byline.jpg)[/caption]

Setting a real name for website administrators is simple. Make sure you remember to do it whenever you set up a new site.
