Today we learnt:







  * The `h1` element. It makes things bigger and thicker.


  * The `font` tag. We use it to change our font (with the `face` attribute) and its size (with the `size` attribute).


  * The `bgcolor` attribute. We use it to change the background colour of things.


  * The `marquee` tag. We use it to create text that scrolls across the screen. Add a `bgcolor` attribute.





We are many miles and years from validation and separation.





Now, we all know what we _should_ be learning before colour, size etc., and that our styles should be tucked away in a separate stylesheet (or in some `style` tags at the very least). But it is interesting to note the students' reaction when their text becomes large, Comic Sansified and animated. Something that would be pretty hard to achieve if we were teaching CSS in addition to HTML.





If this was just about engagement (rather than teaching the right way to do things) it'd be a case of _easy to learn at first_ versus _difficult to learn at first but easier later_. And if you wanted to hook your students you'd be using the `font` tag like crazy.





It's a song about school…
