#1 in a series of ? . . .

I lack visual flair when it comes to typography.  I'm OK at making pages readable, but it's another thing grabbing the attention.  Anyway, I **am** pleased at this bit of CSS:

` `

    
    p.florid {
    font-family: garamond, times, serif;
    font-size: 3em;
    font-style: italic;
    font-weight: normal;
    }


Which produces this little beauty:
