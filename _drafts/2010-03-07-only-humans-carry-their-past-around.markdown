> Everything you did yesterday and last year is viewed as a guarantee of what you will do tomorrow and next year. But what if you are facing an upheaval? What if you’re getting divorced, or you left the Mormon church? What if you’re _ashamed_ of a major upheaval? What if you lost your job and can’t find another one? [Joe Clark](http://blog.fawny.org/2010/03/03/amelioration/).
