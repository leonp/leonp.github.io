I'm not unguilty of this; I once relegated the search form to an archives page in a previous design incarnation, a technique similar to that employed by [CSS Wizardry](http://csswizardry.com/archives/):

We tend to search for something on a website _instead_ of navigating through menus, or when the menus have failed us: placing the search form within the site's architecture makes us go through the whole menu process to begin a search.

Search forms are best placed top right (ahem); failing that, they should be easily available on every page of a website. Anything else is illogical.
