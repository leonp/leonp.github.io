**The movement** (if there is a movement) towards stripped down, [minimum usable design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/05/29/mud-minimum-usable-design/) encourages us to evaluate every element we place on a web page. We discard anything that's unnecessary in order to create a design that's easy to use and, as a result, create a positive impression.

Where does that leave the home page? It seems to me that in a lot of cases the average home page serves one of two functions. Firstly, as a bucket for tons of content. Sometimes that's fine. Council website visitors will have hundreds of different needs, so designers need to prioritise and place information carefully, or even opt for a search first approach:

But too often sites place way too much information on their front page. Look at any UK newspaper website for an example. Why is it the print version gets by on two or three stories while [the online version will serve up several hundred](http://www.guardian.co.uk/)?

The second home page function (and this is worse) is as a decorative advert for the organisation. The most common form of this malaise is the slider; a series of big splash images that noâ€“one ever looks at.

[caption id="attachment_2727" align="aligncenter" width="627"]![EMCAS claims home page](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/emcas1.jpg) The [EMCAS claims home page]( http://www.emcasclaims.co.uk/). Too many animations, graphical effects and pointless info.[/caption]

The sole purpose of the slider is to show the visitor that the organisation was able to hire a web designer who could do animation. It doesn't help the visitor do anything or find information - it's  pointless advertising.

**I expect** home pages will become a lot more bare. Unless you're running a large, complex website, you want your visitors to move away from your home page as soon as possible.

So in that spirit I've reintroduced a traditional index. It's a plain list of what's on my site. No fancy images, no animation and no teaser content. It loads quickly and fits perfectly on a mobile device. Home page perfection.
