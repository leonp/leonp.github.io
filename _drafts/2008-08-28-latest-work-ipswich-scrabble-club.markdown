[Ipswich Scrabble Club](http://ipswichscrabbleclub.co.uk) is a, erm, Scrabble club based in Ipswich, Suffolk.  It's for proper, word-based Scrabble, not the other sort!

The site uses a simple, 3 column design that emphasises important information (contact details, meeting dates etc.)  It's a single page site, but uses WordPress as a back end so the club organisers can add content when required.

It's built on WordPress and uses the fabulous [wp-lite plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wplite/) to make maintenance as simple as possible.

The grid is em based, so it respects readers' font resizing.  XML sitemaps is used to aid SEO.  The WordPress theme weighs in at about 6K.

I'm pretty pleased with it - WordPress makes it really easy to develop these sorts of sites quickly and integrate all sorts of other info (Flickr photos in this case).

If you're looking for a game of Scrabble in the Ipswich area, you know where to head!
