**I really like Bruce Lawson**, and I couldn't agree more with his defence of _[one website for everybody](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/19/why-we-shouldnt-make-separate-mobile-websites/)_ article in Smashing Magazine.

There's one argument that's central to me, and I've been making it for years. As Bruce puts it:


> …sites should be minimal, functional, with everything designed to help the user complete a task, and then go. But that doesn't mean that you need to make a separate mobile site from your normal site. If your normal site isn't minimal, functional, with everything designed to help the user complete a task, it's time to rethink your whole site.

Really wide desktop monitors are way too big for text. They're great for images, but the building block of written communication – the humble paragraph – only needs around 500 pixels of your average monitor at 1em/16 pixels (if you're serving up smaller paragraph text than that you're committing another cardinal sin).

You can up your font size a tad to use up some of that space, but go too far and it's [like punching your reader in both eyes](http://zeldman.com). What to do with those extra 700 pixels?

Filler is the number one reason websites fail to fulfil their most basic function; namely, to enable visitors to perform a task as efficiently as possible. Build for mobile first and your ‘proper’ website will benefit.
