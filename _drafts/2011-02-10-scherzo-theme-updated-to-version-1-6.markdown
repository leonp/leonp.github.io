Another small Scherzo update. If you've already installed the theme you can update it from your WordPress admin panel, otherwise you can [get it from the WordPress themes directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo).

<!-- more -->

Changes from version 1.5:



	
  * changed line height to 18px (1.351em) in picture captions, allowed tags paragraph, entry footers and the site footer

	
  * changed padding around sidebar lists

	
  * changed sidebar list links to `display:inline`, making for better link lists

	
  * made the comments number in entry headers on the front page a link to the comments form on single pages


Comments, bug reports etc. more than welcome.
