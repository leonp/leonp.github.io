The job of a web content editor is to make content comprehensible and something that visitors actually **_want_ to read**. There are several rules we can follow to achieve this: use the active voice, use concrete nouns, use pronouns, avoid jargon etc. etc.

But we often encounter material that's, well, impossible to make something of.  It could be vague, incomprehensible to the reader (and/or the editor) or devoid of any factual content that the reader might be interested in.

The editor has a number of choices when faced by this:



	
  * ask for clarification, more detail etc.

	
  * copy and use as is

	
  * get 'creative' with the content


Of course, the only real option is the first: option two merely abrogates our duty as an editor, while the third can cause confusion (and legal problems!)

The first option is also far from ideal.  It's time consuming and the submitter often feels that he or she has done his or her job in giving you the material.  Far better to ensure that we receive **decent quality material** in the first place.

We could simply email the organisation's style guide to anyone who submits material for publication.  Except that (quite rightly) the recipient might feel that he or she doesn't have time to read the guide, nor time to adhere to its many rules and suggestions. Some may not make sense to those not from an editing/teaching background.  After all, it's the **editor's job** to beat material into shiny, presentable copy.

An alternative is to provide a simple list of dos and don'ts for submitting material.  Leave the capitalisation and formating to the editor.


### The 5 (possible) dos and don'ts of submitting content


Here's a set of rules I'm currently playing with:


#### Don't describe procedure


If you're telling the me about an event, omit details of start times, breakout sessions, number of attendees.  No-one, apart from the event organiser, is interested.


#### Do tell me the basic facts


Make sure you tell me **what, where, when, who and why**.  All these serve to provide the reader with a context in which to understand the story.


#### Do provide photos


Photos of people.  One group photo is fine, smaller group and individual photos are even better.  Provide photos of people involved in the content, rather than images of random office people.

#### Do provide quotes


Direct speech adds a sense of immediacy to an account, while bringing the _dramatis personae_ to life.  If you've provided quotes, make sure there are photos of the people who have spoken


#### Don't over-generalise


If someone at an event states that they want to increase their company's profits, it's hardly news: every company wants to increase its profits.  If that person goes on to describe **_how_ they intend to** increase profits, it's interesting.  As good copywriters we know that if we state the bleeding obvious, or describe ourselves or our products in terms that everyone else would use, it's just marketing flannel.  **Concrete, unique** features are what make copy interesting.

So it doesn't really matter if the material we receive amounts to 40 pages, includes all the presentation slides from an event, 10 photos and is scrawled in idiosynchratic English: as long as there's something to work with we should be able to produce exciting, lively copy that our visitors _want_ to read.
