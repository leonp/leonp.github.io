title: Sorting isn&#8217;t the same as finding

<p class="figcaption">A card sort, yesterday</p>

I've just completed an [open card sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_sorting) at work. Two things struck me:

1. *Sorting things into categories and naming those categories isn't the same as finding something on a website.* Most people aren't great at naming categories. Often they create huge content buckets. Sometimes they'll name a category *Home*, or even *Opportunities for you to develop your skills and abilities in libraries*. There is, of course, an art to classifying and naming groups: an <abbr title="Information Architecture">IA</abbr> isn't going to form itself from your card sorts.
2. *Staff name things from an organisational point view.* I asked some colleagues to complete the sort, taking care to keep their attempts separate from the customers'. As expected, they categorised the information differently, but I was surprised at how often they used corporate language in an attempt to *sound* professional. This resulted in some odd labels.

Card sorts are very useful, but they're not magic. I see them as a starting point for *your* work of categorising and labelling. I'm using <a href="http://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort.htm">Optimal Sort</a> to do the sorts online, or I'll manually enter results.

The main benefit of using a proper testing service is that it'll do lots of analysis for you, so you get an accurate picture of what cards are often grouped together, and the sorts of words and phrases that reoccur throughout the sorts. You can use this info to establish your closed sort category names.

Without this analysis you're either going to do *lots* of complex spreadsheet work yourself, or start guessing.
