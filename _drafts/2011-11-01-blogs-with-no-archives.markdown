**Andy Rutledge has removed his blog archive.** There is a blog post. [Catch it while it's still there](http://www.andyrutledge.com/design-view.php). We do have [Design Professionalism](http://designprofessionalism.com/index.php).

But what happens to blogs with no archives? No category or tag pages? No next or previous links? No author pages?

The blog with no archive is a one page site. An article.

And does the archive—the sheer weight of hundreds of posts—simply make a blog _seem_ worthy?

Time to declutter and do?
