> _Stream of consciousness_: â€¦to render the flow of myriad impressions - visual, auditory, physical, associative, and subliminal - that impinge on the consciousness of an individual and form part of his awareness [Encyclopaedia Britannica](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness)

**As I'm sure you've read**, Oliver Reichenstein (owner of [Information Architects](http://informationarchitects.net/) and not as the name suggests a Sherlock Holmes villain) has been [arguing for a strike through feature for Twitter](http://informationarchitects.net/blog/twitterror/), for those times we say something stupid, erroneous or just get our spelling wrong.





Of course, we can already delete tweets, but there's nothing stopping someone with a big nose who knows from taking a screenshot and retweeting it to the rest of the world. And if we've deleted the offending tweet we look like we've got something to hide.





The strike through option is a smart alternative, but I don't agree with it. And the main reason for that is the nature of Twitter itself.





Twitter, as the name suggests, works best as a stream of consciousness or, perhaps more accurately, the way a conversation does in real life.





In a real conversation we stumble around a subject, mispronounce words, get facts wrong, repeat ourselves and do all sorts of non-linear, unclear things. We edit as we go along.





When we make a mistake we correct ourselves later (or pretend that we didn't in fact make a mistake, or that we were misinterpreted). All a part of being all too human. And that's exactly how Twitter works, only the conversation takes place in front of [41,141 followers](http://twitter.com/iA).





If we could strike out tweets we didn't mean Twitter would lose a part of its spontaneity. It'd become more of a publication platform than a real time messaging service.





The pay-off for superbrands like iA is that we trust what they're saying. When Twitter's used properly there's no marketing spin or edited _message_. Marketing departments hate that, but there's nothing more of a turn off than a brand tweeting on message stuff at us.
