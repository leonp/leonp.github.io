How do you balance measurable things like the file size of a website's assets versus intangibles like branding? Or, to put it another way, when is it worth sacrificing measurable performance for something else?

Let's look at an example. [The Guardian's mobile site](http://m.guardian.co.uk/) uses its own (very handsome) Guardian Egyptian slab serif typeface, which [it introduced along with the Berliner format in 2005](http://www.guardian.co.uk/gpc/berliner-format). Here's how it renders in Windows 7:

There are, as far as I can see, two problems with Guardian Egyptian:



	
  * it renders poorly in Windows 7

	
  * it weighs in at a hefty 460kb


The Guardian isn't the only website that faces this problem, but 460kb is a large price to pay for a juddery font:

So has The Guardian done the right thing? I'd argue it hasn't. 460kb is too high a price to pay for branding when you could easily use the typeface more judiciously, perhaps for headings or the logotype. There is always Georgia for body copy. I wonder if anyone at The Guardian actually considered this a problem.

Is there a balance to be reached here? And if there is, where does it lie?
