[Get the latest version of Scherzo](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes/).

<del>I finally got round to releasing version 2.4 of Scherzo. The first major change is that it's not available from the WordPress themes directory, so you'll need to delete the old version and reinstall this one. The second is that old versions of Internet Explorer now display the two column layout on wide screens.</del>



## Changes





	
  * HTML5 shiv and css3-mediaqueries js links now placed within IE conditional comments in `header.php`

	
  * HTML5 shiv and css3-mediaqueries js linked to Google Code hosting

	
  * theme therefore scales in IE5+ and all modern browsers

	
  * added simple post formats

	
  * moved `wp_footer` hook back out of `#site-footer` (as per WP theme guidelines)

	
  * changed body `line-height` to 1.5. It's now unitless.

	
  * improved header scaling at small viewport widths (with thanks to [Manuel Martensen](http://manuelmartensen.com/))

	
  * added a `wide` class so images can stretch across main column and sidebar column

	
  * added simple support for post formats (aside, image, link, quote, audio and video)

	
  * improved print stylesheet

	
  * typographical tweeks and improvements

	
  * sidebar markup more logical: one `aside` with `div`s for front, universal and single widget areas

	
  * differentiated narrow screen and wide screen `blockquote` styling

	
  * better tag cloud styling
