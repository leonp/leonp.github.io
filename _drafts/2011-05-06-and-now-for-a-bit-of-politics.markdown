This website's tagline is _Books, politics and other gubbins_. So far I've written about books and some other gubbins, but nothing about politics.

So, as the 2011 local election results are published, here goes…

(But first, a disclaimer: I make absolutely no claims as to my expertise in this subject. You probably also need to know that I'm a Labour party member. And those two sentences are unconnected.)


## An OK result for Labour


As expected, Labour has profited from a Lib Dem collapse, especially in the North of England (Sheffield, Hull and a number of other councils are now Labour run).

Labour gains in the South have been more modest (although I'm hoping we win overall control of Ipswich). This will prove a source of disappointment as the party is well aware that it can't rely on so called heartlands to win a general election. [The south is important to Labour](http://www.nextleft.org/2010/10/why-southern-discomfort-is-different.html).

Having said that, this isn't like the early 80s, where Labour was pulverised all over the country. Labour has a strong presence in lots of southern seats, and government cuts have yet to kick in.

The economic signs are not good: if the economy does slip into recession the Tory message about cuts will sound more and more unrealistic. GDP has flatlined over the last six months, and [the manufacturing sector — which was bolstering these figures — is starting to slow as well](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/may/05/service-sector-growth-slow-down). If the debate moves away from cuts to growth Labour has a clearer, less defensive message here (and an opportunity to develop that message).

**Scotland was a disaster**, but, to me, entirely understandable. There are two reasons for the SNP victory:



	
  * Labour portrayed the Scottish election as a chance to send a statement to (the Westminster) government, rather than as an election about Scotland

	
  * the SNP offers Scottish voters a proper radical alternative to the political consensus. Ask any left leaning person whether they think medical prescriptions, university tuition and care for the elderly should be free, and they'll answer _yes_. No mainstream English party offers these choices; if they did, it'd probably result in electoral suicide. In Scotland, the Tories are so weak that it's not an issue.




## Lib Dems


Dire.


## A good result for the Tories


The results show that the Lib Dems are taking the hit for the coalition's policies — unsurprising, as these policies are a million miles away from those they offered in the 2010 general election. This is essentially a Conservative government, and [Lib Dem moaning is pissing in the wind](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lord-ashdown-trust-in-cameron-is-damaged-2279983.html).

The results show that — in the South especially — the Tory narrative about _reigning in spending_ and _maxing out the country's credit card_ is still prevalent. There is, of course, a natural Tory electorate that is against public spending on ideological grounds, and it's likely to be pretty happy at the moment.

I also suspect that David Cameron's own performance has helped the Conservative vote. Obviously I'm not a fan, but so far he's fulfilled the main function of any PM by not dropping any clangers. [Some argue that Ed Milliband's own performance has not been too impressive](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-the-plan-to-save-ed-miliband-2258737.html). Whatever the case, there's no Gordon Brown factor (yet).

Overall, the results show that the country is becoming more divided in its politics — Labour and Conservative support has firmed up. Again, this is unsurprising when the centre party's vote has collapsed.

If there was a general election tomorrow, Labour would win with a small majority. As a Labour party member, that fills me with some hope as it demonstrates that there's no Tory majority in the country, and no collapse of the Labour vote.

It'll be all about the economy.
