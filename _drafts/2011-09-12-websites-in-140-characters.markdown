Job application forms. Absolutely horrible things that encourage you to write loads of turgid nonsense about yourself that no-one in their right mind would read without the bullshit sensors set to maximum. So, [inviting applications by Twitter](http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2011/09/12/regional-newspaper-editor-asks-for-job-applications-via-twitter/) is a stellar idea. Unfortunately, most business websites are written like job applications.
