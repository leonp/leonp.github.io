Another day, another Scherzo update. [Download it from the Theme Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo) or, if you've already installed it, update from your site's admin panel. You can also take a look at a [live demo](http://leonpaternoster.com/scherzo).

<!-- more -->

A small one this time:



	
  * changed sidebar font size so text that isn't wrapped in tags is rendered at 13px rather than 16px

	
  * added `max-width` styles to sidebar images

	
  * added a skip to content link (unforgivable that I'd neglected this)

	
  * added author info and link to post meta

	
  * changed theme description and theme page link


**Add any comments, bug reports or feature requests to [the theme page](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes/).**
