10 minutes. Strictly timetabled day, straight into all that stuff. Normal work allows you to sit down, breathe and make yourself a hot drink. Not this. There's always work to do and you're always just 10 minutes away from doing something, performing.

Eight minutes.

Preparation done, but that doesn't mean you're prepared for what will happen. There's the rub. I guess some people _are_ prepared for every eventuality, but not me. Not yet.

Like the Johnny Cash song. Six more minutes to go.

Voices are louder outside now. They'll suddenly break as they enter the building. Shouting. Me, up, ready to greet, and off we go.

Four more minutes.

See you later. No editing allowed.
