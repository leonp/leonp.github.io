**Smashing Magazine** have been kind enough to feature me in their latest WordPress theme round-up.

I must admit to feeling slightly apprehensive at having my work exposed to so many people, especially when you compare how stark and unadorned my theme is to some of the others in the article.

I'm already thinking of moving on to my next theme. I'm sure many developers share my feelings of dissatisfaction with a work that's just been 'completed' (in fact, I doubt these things ever feel finished).

Many thanks if you're taking the time to browse through some posts, and I hope you find something mildly diverting. Any feedback gratefully received!
