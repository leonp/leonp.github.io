Scherzo moves on to version 1.4. [Download the latest version](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo) from the WordPress theme directory or take a look at [the demo](http://leonpaternoster.com/scherzo).

Most of the changes are behind the scenes and have been made in an effort to add the theme to the official WordPress theme depository. However, the front end has been affected too:



	
  * the navigation menu has been removed (you can add custom menus to the sidebar)

	
  * removed the archives template

	
  * added child list styles for the sidebar so sub menus are displayed better

	
  * added author post styling
