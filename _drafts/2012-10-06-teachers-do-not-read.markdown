The irony of being a teacher of English (and an English teacher) is that you don't get to read much. There's just not enough time.





Incredibly, some people hold the [absurd notion that teachers are out of the gate and heading home at 3 o'clock](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19683920). In my experience this is simply untrue. Last week my working day ran from around 7.30am to 6pm, with a 20m break. What people outside of teaching probably don't appreciate is the stress of a strictly timetabled day--you _have_ to be in your classroom at a given time, which means you _have_ to complete work by that time. If you don't you're doomed to a nightmarish lesson.





I get home at around 6.45, eat and get the kids ready for bed (well, my wife does most of this work, but still). I try and finish my school work at school, but most nights there's a small amount of printing or reading to be done. The working day ends at around 8 o'clock. I'm in bed by 10 and up at 5.45am. Repeat until half term.





No time to read.





Of course, when I was doing a completely pointless job I had lots of time to read. [Check out the archives](http://blog.leonpaternoster.com/archives/). I even read [Paradise Lost](http://blog.leonpaternoster.com/paradise-lost/).





I'm not sure whether this is a professional problem. I miss reading proper, adult books, but I know Traitor, Face, Tribes and newspaper articles about Richard III and a Leicester car park inside out.
