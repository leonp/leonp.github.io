The 133 theme is essentially an experiement, or a diversion: a way to kill a couple of spare hours on a Saturday afternoon with Radio 5 on in the background and no domestic football to distract me (although I'll probably be able to follow my team on international weekends in the very near future). It took 133 minutes to make.

I had a few things in mind when writing the theme: I wanted a traditionally paginated, dive into the full content affair, and something that's both easy to read and doesn't make the reader think of anything beyond flicking between posts.

**Format and comments**

From a writer's point of view, it's more like a [Tumblog](http://www.tumblr.com/) or [Posterous](http://posterous.com), but with half decent markup. You could use it to post pictures, quick thoughts etc. **I removed the WordPress commenting system** altogether and replaced it with a simple _Tweet this post_ link by incorporating the [Simple Twitter Link plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-twitter-link/) (NB: you won't have to install any plugins as it's built into the theme). There's **no archive, no navigation menu**.

I've also added a field to User → Your profile → Extra profile information which will allow you to add your Twitter ID to the _Tweet this post_ link (useful for tracking Tweetbacks).

Please note that the theme won't display tweetbacks: I've added this functionality to my own version.

Behind the scenes, it's built on a slightly modified version of the [Sandbox theme](http://code.google.com/p/sandbox-theme/): very few changes were made to the PHP files and the CSS weighs in at around 250 lines (including comments).

It's ready to use now. I may add search and archives in future versions. Or maybe not.
