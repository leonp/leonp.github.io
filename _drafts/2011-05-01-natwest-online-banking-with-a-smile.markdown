I love my bank [Natwest](http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/targets/banks/rbs-natwest). Do you know why I love Natwest? It’s because Natwest ladies smile an awful lot.

Apparently, not many men work at Natwest. But you can be sure of one thing: If more men did work at Natwest, they would SMILE! an awful lot, probably because working at Natwest makes you very happy.

Here's a Natwest man. Now, he isn't smiling, but that's because he does the serious _management_ stuff, not like the Natwest ladies.

Even when I want to do something as mundane as login and check my bank balance, Natwest ladies smile at me. Four times do Natwest ladies smile. It's a journey through the very nature of smiling. A Natwest smile says a lot.


## 1. Hi!


At this stage we at Natwest are _extremely_ happy to see you. We don’t know who you are, but you’re a customer, and Natwest LIKES its customers.

## 2. So you want to log in?


Righty oh. If you _do_ have any problems, we at Natwest are _quite_ happy to help, and that makes us smile a bit.

## 3. Hooray! You’ve logged in to Natwest!


Oh, you’re _that_ Leon.

I am smiling, but it’s just that you’re not that rich.


## 4. Congratulations, you safely logged out.

Well done and all that, but perhaps you need to talk to us at Natwest? It’s for the best. I am smiling, though.
