Following [Ben’s tweet about CNET’s less than unobtrusive cookie opt–in popup][1], I got thinking about these messages.

They’re now so common you probably don’t even notice them, even when they take up 112px of your laptop screen:<figure class="figure alignnone">

How many people ignore it and just carry on browsing?</figcaption></figure> 
## 4 reasons cookie banners are useless

1. Unless you’re putting 3rd party ads on your site, you don’t need them
:   In June 2012 the EU data protection authorities adopted an “opinion” that:
:   > First party analytics cookies are not likely to create a privacy risk if websites provide clear information about the cookies to users and privacy safeguards, eg a user friendly mechanism to opt out from any data collection and where they ensure that identifiable information is anonymised. <cite><a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies">ICO Cookie Guidance</a></cite>
:   In other words, if you’re using Google Analytics to collect data about your own website, you’re fine. You can’t tell *who* is using your website through analytics, and “clear” doesn’t mean “big banner on every page”. We interpreted it as an entry in the help menu and [a plainly written explanation of what information we collect and what we use it for][2].

2. They’re a pain
:   They get in the way. They make your visitors read something, interpret it and then make a decision, when all they wanted to do was read the news.

3. So you just ignore them
:   We associate banners with advertising, and over the years we’ve learned to filter them out. If a cookie banner does catch our attention, it always says exactly the same thing – another reason not to bother reading.

4. They use marketese
:   You see, we’re not putting this cookie on your computer so we can track which pages you visit, tell what device you’re using and figure out where you came to our website from. Oh no, it’s to *improve your experience*.
:   Of course, we may well use all this information to improve your experience of our website. But that’s not what the cookies themselves do. And we could use all that information for a host of other purposes.
:   If there’s one area where we need to write plainly it’s privacy. [Talk of user experience is often a smokescreen][3].

## A bodged law

It is wrong for us to put files on our website visitors’ computers without their explicit permission.

The law should have made it illegal to set cookies without visitors opting in. Instead, we’re allowed to assume they’re OK with it.

Of course, if we had a proper law no–one would bother opting in, and a big bit of the internet would break.
