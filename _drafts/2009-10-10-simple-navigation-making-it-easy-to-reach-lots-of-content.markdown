If you [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/leonpaternoster) or read this blog you'll know that I'm a big fan of [Information Architects Japan](http://informationarchitects.jp). I don't think there's any other agency that combines usability, simplicity, brand and aesthetics so well: their blog and Twitter streams are a constant source of creative, original ideas. Unsurprisingly, they get a lot of [high profile work](http://www.zeit.de/index) and media coverage.

They recently redesigned their website. It's a brilliant effort, retaining the large, Georgia font face (it was once helvetica, believe it or not), simple typography, black/red and white colour scheme and uncluttered layout that has become their brand. They've also simplified the content presentation, making it even easier to read and navigate. They use [some interesting copy to market themselves](http://informationarchitects.jp/network/). There are many things to admire.


### How to make nine pages easy to find


iA have taken a textual approach to marketing themselves: rather than simply presenting a gallery of their work, they've written several mid–length pieces on subjects such as _networking_, _profile_ and _method_. It's an almost unfashionable approach, but one that reflects the fact that they don't just produce nice–looking, gallery–friendly websites.

Designers would normally present this information in one of the following ways:



	
  * Display all the pages in horizontal or vertical menu

	
  * Keep the top level navigation as simple as possible and allow the user to reach the detailed stuff by following a path that leads to more detailed information as s/he clicks through the site. The most obvious way to do this would be through creating a top level _About_ page and linking to the longer texts from this page.

	
  * Create a simple top level menu that pops out further options when the user hovers over _About_

	
  * Place some “teaser” content on the front page (e.g. a customer quote) that links through to some more detailed information


Here's what iA have done:

So instead of minimising the menu options _eveything_ is placed within reach of every page. Normally, this would result in an unwieldy, hard–to–scan list of links. What iA have done is incredibly simple: they've categorised the top level menu and presented the links by category. No pop out menus, fancy gradients or text shadows; just plain, well organised text that's easy to read and a site that's easy to navigate.

Genius: [the interface as brand](http://informationarchitects.jp/the-interface-of-a-cheeseburger/).
