title: Can Labour win from the centre?
---

Leo poses the question on a few people's lips after Jeremy Corbyn scraped onto the Labour leader nomination card: [_Can Labour win from the left?_](http://www.noiseofthecrowd.com/can-labour-win-from-the-left/#comment-10380) Except, he's not really asking that. What's he's really asking is _Can Labour win without adopting the Tories' rightwing spending strategy?_

I'm amazed at what passes for &#8216;left&#8217; these days. If, along with the likes of Chuka and Liz, you mean not supporting Tory spending targets then it's an oddly broad church, including the governments of Japan, France, Germany and the US.

Don't believe me? Here's [what % of six leading economies' GDP will go on government spending by 2017](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2000&ey=2017&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=156%2C132%2C134%2C144%2C112%2C136%2C111%2C158&s=NGDP_RPCH%2CGGX_NGDP&grp=0&a=&pr1.x=65&pr1.y=16), according to the IMF:

Or if you'd prefer a graph:

In very plain words _you don't have to be Jeremy Corbyn to argue against the Tories' spending plans_ &#8211; you just have to be less hawkish than the government of the United States. But here's the odd thing: it's not just the Tories who frame the argument in these terms, but the front bench of the Labour Party as well.

It's not as if austerity makes sense as anything beyond a response to some sort of immediate fiscal &#8216;emergency&#8217;. How can austerity be an end in itself? How can you cut spending but increase pension payments every year? How can you maintain health and education funding? How can you stop tax receipts diminishing?

[The centre ground needs reclaiming](/2015/06/the-last-liberal-centre-broke/). As to _why_ Labour is so willing to cede it, I'm not sure. Perhaps it doesn't have the stomach to take on the Tories. Perhaps the British really are somehow inherently more hawkish than the Germans. Whatever the reason, the argument needs reframing soon, because in a fight between Jeremy Corbyn and the Tories, there's only one winner.
