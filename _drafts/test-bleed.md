title: Test a bleeding image

First we'll try a short paragraph of text, as it's unlikely we'll jump straight in with an image.

<img class="bleed" src="http://www.bureau-b.com/images/Faust%20Zappi%20%28Credit%20Ian%20Land%29.jpg" alt="Zappi">

<p class="figcaption">This be a caption. I've changed caption line height and doubled the border. How does a long caption look?</p>

Then we'll add another paragraph, thereby restoring order to the world. Now we're going to display an image of something else that's German. Can you make the connection? Plenty of others have.

<p class="figcaption">This be a short caption.</p>

And then we return to a normal paragraph, unruffled, serene, facing the future words and days.
