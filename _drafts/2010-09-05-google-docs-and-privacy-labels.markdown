Is there a better way to phrase this? I had to pause and figure out what it meant. What other types of privacy does Google recognise?

Perhaps Google Docs should reserve the _Private_ label for unshared documents and describe the extent to which other files have been shared. For example:



	
  * _this document has been shared with 20 people_

	
  * _anybody can view this document_
