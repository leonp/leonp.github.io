[Outdated UX patterns](http://sideproject.io/outdated-ux-patterns/) is a useful reminder of the sorts of things you shouldn't be using when you build content for the web. However, you'll insist on using them for a handful of reasons:

- They look good and add some whizz to your web page
- Everyone else is doing them
- They make stakeholders and customers happy. Stakeholders look at your work in the same way they look at a painting, rather than as something people use in order to do something.

I'm not unguilty. Over the last couple of years I've built several pages that use big splash images. I've also played with tabbed navigation and popovers. I meant well.

It's interesting how the suggested alternatives for these outdated practices are in fact older than the practices themselves. The best way to present overlay content is to put it on a new page. Who'd have thought.

These alternatives also give us an insight into the value of professionals. While you can buy an off the peg website from Squarespace for next to nothing, it will look exactly the same as millions of other sites &#8211; and commit the same UX errors. The Squarespace designers aren't designing for website users; they're designing for people who are trawling hundreds of galleries for stuff that looks modern, cool, up to date etc. but are worried about choosing something they haven't seen before.

As builders of things for the web we face a challenge here. We need to get our customers and stakeholders to see that our job isn't to simply produce nice looking things. Kick off meetings are important &#8211; make sure you're asking things like _who is this for?_, _what things would they like to do online?_ and _what's the most important task here?_ If your stakeholder/customer hasn't thought these things through offer to find out for them through looking at analytics and doing some form of customer research.
