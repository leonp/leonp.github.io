One of the good things about using WordPress again is that I build lots of themes. My latest is *mm*, a simple, (hopefully) fast and minimal one column affair. I think it&#8217;s robust enough to offer the wider world.

*   [Get mm][1]
*   [Demo][2]

Post any questions, bugs, queries etc. on [Github][3] or [Twitter][4].

## About mm

I&#8217;ve tried to keep HTML and CSS files as small as possible and minimise the number of calls to external assets. There&#8217;s just one stylesheet (which incorporates the table and button modules of [Pure CSS][5]) and no javascript.

No comments, I&#8217;m afraid. No sidebar, either.

The default font is Georgia&thinsp;&#8212;&thinsp;it&#8217;s easy to create a child theme that uses Google fonts or Typekit.

There&#8217;s a custom menu in the footer. I expect the big orange *More articles &rarr;* button will serve as the main navigation.
