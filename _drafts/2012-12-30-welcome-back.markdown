Back in September I wrote aÂ _Goodbye for now_ post as I was about to start a new job as a teacher. I didn't envisage having the time or the inclination to carry on writing about the web, and to a certain extent I was right. I carried on blogging on a subdomain about things like debt, the rhetoric of the working poor(!) and not having the time to read the books I wanted to.

But I also wrote about the design of [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/), web typography and [The Guardian's mobile site](http://m.guardian.co.uk/). Stuff I would have covered when I was a web editor. So I had an old, unused blog here and a new, fairly regularly updated blog elsewhere that banged on about the same subjects as here. In short, a mess.

I don't think anyone really cares what I write about. Blogging wisdom dictates that you keep to a certain topic, but I only have around 150 to 200 visitors a day, and most of them are taking a look at my [Scherzo WordPress theme](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes). I'm under no illusion that the blog is for anyone else apart from me. Combine with a diffuse mix of web, politics and Ipswich Town FC Twitter chums and there's no real need to keep to the same topics all the time.

So I've reincorporated all my posts here and will continue to write about all sorts of things, no doubt including The Guardian's website.
