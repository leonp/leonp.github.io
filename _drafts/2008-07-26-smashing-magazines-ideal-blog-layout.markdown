[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="Smashing Magazine screenshot"]![Smashing Magazine - fairly typical in its design when compared to other popular blogs](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/2722829344_01bd23dbb3_o.gif)[/caption]

Smashing Magazine did some [interesting research](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/24/a-small-study-of-big-blogs/) on the **top 100** blogs on Technorati: they looked at common typographical and page layout features and collated the information into a handy list.

In turn, I've designed an HTML/CSS **template **that incorporates the most **popular **features of big blogs.  See it here:

Or

[Download the zipped HTML and CSS files](http://intothewhite.co.uk/bitsandbobs/smashingmagazineidealblog/ideal_blog.zip)

The blogs share these features:



	
  * large blogs require a multi-column layout solution (usually 3 columns suffice) (58%);

	
  * layouts are usually centered (94%),

	
  * layouts usually have a fixed width (px-based) (92%),

	
  * the width of the fixed layout varies between 951 and 1000px (56%),

	
  * 58% of the overall site layout is used to display the main content,

	
  * CSS-layouts are used (90%),

	
  * the background is light, the body text is dark (98%),

	
  * the most usual (not necessarily most user-friendly) line length lies between 80 and 100 characters,

	
  * Verdana, Lucida Grande, Arial and Georgia are used for body text (90%),

	
  * the font size of body text varies between 12 and 14px (78%),

	
  * Arial and Georgia are used for headlines (52%),

	
  * headlines have the font size between 17 and 25px.


Disclaimers:

	
  * The information probably represents such factors as design trends, current conventions and the designers' own tastes and quirks.  There is no correlation between layout and typography and popularity: content is king.

	
  * I think it's a pretty poor design: body copy is too small and the layout is too fussy.


Anyway, feel free to leave a comment!
