Over the last few months we’ve been making two big changes to Suffolk libraries&#8217; IT. Firstly, we’ve been installing wifi, so customers can come into a library and use their phone/laptop/tablet for free.

We’re doing the final testing at [Ipswich County][1], Suffolk’s biggest library. You can come in and use the (very quick) wifi now – we should officially ‘launch’ the service in the next couple of weeks.

For years, libraries have provided slow, out of date Windows PCs. Customers come in and sit at banks of ugly tower computers and wait for 15 minutes while their PC logs in, before checking email, word processing, going on Facebook etc.

We’re finally replacing these PCs with a mix of high spec Dells and, more interestingly, Chrome PCs and Chromebooks.<figure class="figure aligncenter">

So I’m writing this post (in my lunch, natch) in County Library’s fabulous Nortgate Room, under the gaze of a stainedglass Francis Bacon. I’m using a superquick laptop provided by the library and some nifty, free wifi.<figure class="figure aligncenter">

This has to be the future of libraries – a free, non-commercial, flexible space where you can relax and spend a couple of hours. It beats going to a coffee shop hands down.

Now, if we did just have a cafe here too…
