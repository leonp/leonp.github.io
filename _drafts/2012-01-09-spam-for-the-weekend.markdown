We had a spam attack at the weekend. I'm not sure if it originated from some robot or, more worryingly, humans sat at computers across the world, typing, copying and pasting this stuff.

The comments are designed to make some form of sense, thereby bypassing spam filters and docile website editors.

Which begs the question: Why not get the spelling right? I know English is fiendishly unphonetic, but these are, on the whole, very brief comments.

And even more odd – _every_ comment contains a misspell. Like it's done on purpose.

There's some poem, song or art to be found in here. Enjoy this weekend's offering:
