First: I will be laptop–free over the next week or so.  I can see emails and possibly respond to blog comments at work, but that's it.  Gulp.

Second: Right–wing Über-designer [Andy Rutledge has been kicking up a storm recently](http://www.andyrutledge.com/design-dissent.php#fragment-3) (this is an excellent piece of writing, by the way).  As one of the 100 or so who emailed Andy, and a left–leaning Britisher, I feel I should write something about this.  I was very nice to Andy, and he sent me a sweet email back, so I wonder if I'm the 1 in a 100 he refers to.

Third: I have redesigned [my home page](http://leonpaternoster.com).  This was one of those flash of inspiration moments where I was able to dispense with 90% of the existing design.  And how nice it is to code simple, plain HTML and CSS, without punctuation-crazy PHP.
