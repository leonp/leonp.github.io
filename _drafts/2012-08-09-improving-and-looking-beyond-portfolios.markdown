**Florent posted an interesting piece** on [whether web designers should publish portfolios](http://fvsch.com/notes/2012/portfolios/) (I'm sure the question is pertinent elsewhere too):


> Typical portfolios only present the end result of a designer’s work and put huge stress on graphic design (vs, say, interaction design)… If you don’t want to put the focus on the work rather than on graphic design or the finished product, then write about the process. Show different stages of work. Discuss design decisions. Do it as formal case studies or short posts or highlights or in any other way (it’s likely that there are communication forms to be invented or developed here, especially if you want to reach non-designers). [Florent Verschelde](http://fvsch.com/notes/2012/portfolios/)


Florent is right when he says the decision depends on several factors, including your customers. When I was touting for business from the general public my portfoilo page consisted of a screenshot, a short paragraph describing what the site had done for the customer and a link to the site itself. Not your typical graphic design approach, but I'm sure customers simply _looked_ at the site and made a decision based its appearance. They weren't thinking about interaction design.

That's not to knock the customer. [Designers often judge websites on their appearance rather than functionality](http://leonpaternoster.com/2012/08/evaluating-text-functionality/), so it's hardly surprising customers think in the same terms. As Florent says, portfolios simply talk about the wrong things. How many designer sites have you seen that consist of a huge slider? The challenge is to present information about how you can help customers in a way that they can relate to.

But it's interesting to note that very few of my leads have come from a portfolio page on my site. Potential customers might have looked at a competitor's site, a site I'd already built, contacted me via Twitter, downloaded a free WordPress theme, asked me to do more work for them or on one occasion simply called after picking up a business card they found in a cafe. [Getting mentioned in Smashing Magazine – see theme 28](http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2008/08/25/30-free-high-quality-wordpress-themes/) used to generate lots of leads.

A portfolio page is valuable because it shows that people have paid you to do work for them. It helps build credibility.

But it's also worth asking: _How important is my portfolio page? How else can I get business?_
