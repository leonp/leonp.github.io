Journalism.co.uk provided [a peak at the forthcoming paywall blocked Times](http://www.journalism.co.uk/5/articles/538703.php). Note, 25 May: The site went live today, so you can [see it in all its glory](http://thetimes.co.uk):

What's good about it?



	
  * simple navigation that allows readers to _find_ content they’re interested in (just nine top level sections; interesting that _Puzzles_ makes it to the top). The use of images for nav bar links is strange: It blurs the text. I'm sure Times would have proved an acceptable font.

	
  * so I don't have to scan 200 front page stories. The print version of the paper points the way to a clear, logical online structure. Note, 25 May: The site went live today. There's still too much _stuff_ on the home page, in my opinion.

	
  * it’s called _The Times_ rather than _timesonline_: after all we do know it’s online because we’re looking at it on a screen


This simplification makes the whole thing look a lot _classier_.

I was thinking that the comments section will be greatly improved by the paywall (after all, you’re paying to comment; no more anonymity, name calling or baiting):

But that doesn’t mean people will pay. I don’t think people are as loyal to an online newspaper as its print counterpart. We’re like magpies, choosing bits and pieces, getting pointed to various publications via a million sources. There’s also a lot more free choice online. Note, 25 May: Clicking on a link to be presented with a login dialogue is one _odd_ experience on a newspaper site. There's something very counter-intuitive about it.

Yes, some paywalls work, but, [as 37 Signals point out, only the ones that help you make money](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2245-when-opening-the-wallet-becomes-a-no-brainer).
