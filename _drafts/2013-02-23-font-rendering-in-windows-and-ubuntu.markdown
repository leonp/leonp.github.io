I like half term. It means I get time to experiment with with my website.

This time round I thought I'd try out some different serifs and make use of my Typekit subscription. I looked at 5 typefaces.

Initially, I viewed the results with Firefox on Linux Mint, a version of Ubuntu. In my opinion, Ubuntu's font rendering engine gives similar results to Mac OS X: all fonts look smooth, if somewhat hazy on occasion.

After trying Meta Serif, Tisa, Skolar, Calluna and Adobe Garamond I plumped for Tisa. These things are subjective, but Tisa set at 118.75% (usually 19px) within a 28em measure (usually 532 pixels) was clearly legible and looked cool, modern and crisp. It also sported a ready partner in Tisa Sans.

The next most legible typeface was Meta Serif, but it was bigger and rounder than Tisa, making it look more like Georgia, which I was trying to get away from.

(A side note: I'm experimenting with shorter measures at the moment. I reckon we've become used to them over the last few years.)

Skolar was too ornate for my taste: I felt the (very attractive) appearance distracted from the text. Body copy should be more utilitarian. I found Calluna and Adobe Garmond too scratchy for reading.


## The Windows ‘problem’


Then I took a look at my site in Chrome and Firefox on Windows 7. Again, this is subjective, but I found all the fonts apart from Tisa and Meta Serif exhibited pronounced jagged edges, making them nearly illegible. Even Tisa and Meta Serif were too jagged for my liking.

It's worth noting that IE9+ renders fonts in a more Mac like way. If you're looking for a broader, more legible reading experience it's probably your best Windows choice.

So I reverted to Georgia. You know it'll work everywhere. If it was only available via Typekit or Font Deck it would be the most the downloaded font.

However, there is still hope if you're looking for a more angular, modern looking serif than Georgia that's legible across operating systems. My sixth choice, PT Serif, renders well on Windows 7, presumably because it's better hinted than the alternatives (it certainly packs a few kbs). It's also available from Google Web Fonts. I don't think it's as sophisticated as Tisa, but it's pleasing enough. It also comes with an excellent sans partner.

So that's what I'm wearing at the moment. But Georgia is calling again.
