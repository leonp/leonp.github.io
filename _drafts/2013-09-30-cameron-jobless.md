title: David Cameron helps a jobless
---

I promise not to post anything political for a little bit. Maybe. Bit difficult when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24327470">Gideon basically declares long&#8211;term unemployment a crime</a>.

I guess you all have a simple choice. Believe their bilious nonsense or not.

Anyway:
