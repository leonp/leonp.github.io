Horrible Histories author Terry Deary has been making some controversial comments about libraries (see [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/feb/13/libraries-horrible-histories-terry-deary) and [The Sunderland Echo](http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/local/all-news/sunderland-libraries-facing-closure-under-850-000-savings-plan-1-5401946)).

It's always a good thing to hear an alternative point of view. However, I think Deary's wrong.

Just a couple of thoughts:
	
* _Libraries don't just lend print books_. We use Ipswich Library a lot. Over the last year I reckon we've borrowed 30 or so print books for the kids (including a Deary title this week, coincidentally enough), 10 for my wife, 20 DVDs and around 10 Nintendo games. I've also printed and photocopied several documents, sampled some Bengali food at a cultural festival and entered the kids in the Summer Reading Challenge. A few years back I took the kids to a weekly singalong (you may remember me as I was the only man there). The point is that libraries are far more than book lending buildings; they're community spaces that place reading in a natural, comfortable context for kids.
*  _His sums don't add up_. Deary accuses libraries of cutting authors' throats. He even blames them for the decline of the bookshop. Apart from the fact that libraries and bookshops have happily co-existed for centuries (the internet dunnit), I think it's misguided to assume that every loan could have resulted in a sale for Deary. I wonder if libraries actually make sales for authors. After all, I doubt we would have bought the three Deary books and two Horrible Histories games we own without sampling his books from the library first.

(Disclaimer: I start work for Suffolk Libraries in April.)
