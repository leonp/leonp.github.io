title: A good watch
---

It's Christmas, and I'd like a watch.

Now, if I was a footballer, I'd probably consider a Bentley Breitling. David Beckham wears a Bentley Breitling. So does Sam Allardyce.

Here's the website description:

> British chic, Swiss excellence: Breitling for Bentley combines the best of both worlds. Style and performance. Luxury and accomplishment. Class and audacity. Power and refinement. Perfectly epitomising this exceptional world, the Bentley B06 chronograph houses a Manufacture Breitling calibre, chronometer&#8211;certified by the COSC (Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute), the highest benchmark in terms of precision and reliability. It is distinguished by its exclusive &#8220;30&#8211;second chronograph&#8221; system enabling extremely precise readings of the measured times. A proud alliance between the grand art of British carmaking and the fine Swiss watchmaking tradition. <cite><a href="http://www.breitlingforbentley.com/en/">Bentley Breitling website</a></cite>

But I want something well designed, and I'm not sure this is. Also, I'm not [Patrick Bateman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bateman).

What is the *purpose* of this design? What use can we put it to? I don't think messrs Beckham and Allardyce actually *need* a COSC certified system that lets them take extremely precise readings of the measured times, or tell the time in South Georgia.

No. The purpose of this watch is to be &#8211; and look &#8211; expensive. And it does that very well. It's a layered, multi&#8211;featured baroque masterpiece.

But proper, [grown up design is about utility and cost](/2013/03/tschichold-democratic-design-and-the-politics-of-typefaces). That's why Swatch, Skagen, Muji and Casio design the best watches. I've had this Casio (&pound;6.99 from Argos) for 2 years:

<p>It does 3 things I need the Breitling doesn't:</p>

1. When I was a teacher, it told me the exact time at a glance so I knew how long there was until the end of the lesson
2. It's waterproof
3. It has a stopwatch so I can time my swim

And it doesn't cost a quarter of my annual salary.

Or if I want something that tells the time and looks sleek, I'll go for Muji:

(Of course, [Muji](http://www.muji.eu) would need to actually stock the damn thing for Christmas. And let's not mention Muji website design.)
