> Remain seated as little as possible, put no trust in any thought that is not born in the open whilst moving freely about – nor when the muscles are not in festive mood. All prejudices originate in the intestines. A sedentary life – as I have already said elsewhere – is the real sin against the holy spirit. Nietzsche – Ecce Homo


This post [on running and the process of writing](http://www.abccopywriting.com/2013/02/27/on-running-and-writing) from Tom Albrighton reminded me of the Nietzsche.

If you write or design you need to escape the tyranny of the PC and the office chair. In my experience time _in transit_, when the mind's not consciously engaged with anything. This could be running, cycling or, in my case, best of all, walking. You don't need forests, mountains or a seascape; cities and towns are just as good.

I don't really have this time at the moment, so my writing becomes fragmented, a series of poorly connected ideas.
