_Noted_: [Tablets are waiting for their Movable Type](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3334-tablets-are-waiting-for-their-movable-type), another article inspired by [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/).





[I like the design thinking behind The Magazine](http://blog.leonpaternoster.com/the-magazine/), but what I don't get is the obsession with producing something for a closed, proprietary format where the the tech hurdle is high and the consumer is tied to an expensive device.





There is already an easy to program, cheap and distributable technology that lets you publish to millions of people regardless of what kit they're using. [It's been around for over 20 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#History) and consumers know how to use it. It's called HTML.





If you want to package your HTML up into a magazine that people pay for, there's [ePub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB). If Apple wasn't the company behind Newsstand, no-one would bother with it.
