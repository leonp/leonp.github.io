Speed is important. We know this, and there are a few ways to measure how fast your website is. These kind of measures, while inexact, can be more useful than simplistic, uncontextualised bullshit like _how many visitors did you get last month why is it less than this month?_ Obviously, we tend to report on the mainly meaningless.

Have some fun and enter a few addresses into [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) (<i>pagespeed</i>!; so quick the words elide). Some websites will score less than 40/100. Some don't even [configure the viewport](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport), for the love of God.

Report on your score instead of some broadsword notion of SEO. Yes, we may wonder how we earn a 63 as opposed to a 54, but we learn something about the _experience_ of using a website on a mobile phone.

Peer through the veil and beyond flashy graphics, animations and general bejazzle. How long does it take to do something and say goodbye to your website?

## Improve your PageSpeed score

Now, I cheat. No javascript, less than 10k of CSS; not even a web font. I should be able to score well. Ya.
