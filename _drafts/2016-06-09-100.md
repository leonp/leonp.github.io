Speed is important. We know this, and there are a few ways to measure how fast your website is. These kind of measures, while inexact, can be more useful than simplistic, uncontextualised bullshit like _how many visitors did you get last month why is it less than this month?_ Obviously, we tend to report on the mainly meaningless.

Have some fun and enter a few addresses into [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) (<i>pagespeed</i>!; so quick the words elide). Some websites will score less than 40/100. Some don't even [configure the viewport](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport), for the love of God.

Report on your score instead of some broadsword notion of SEO. Yes, we may wonder how we earn a 63 as opposed to a 54, but we learn something about the _experience_ of using a website on a mobile phone.

Peer through the veil and beyond flashy graphics, animations and general bejazzle. How long does it take to do something and say goodbye to your website?

## Improve your PageSpeed score

Now, [I cheat](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.leonpaternoster.com%2F). I serve flat files, keine javascript, less than 10k of CSS; not even a web font. I should be able to score well. Ya.

But I still need to do a few things to get a perfect 100.

### Inline your CSS

Each file you call incurs an overhead of 14k. So, if you've got less than 14k of CSS dump it in the `head` and earn yourself 9 PageInsight points. You won't even have to bother whether it's critical or non-critical CSS.

### Use flat HTML

Obvious this, but a site built on Jekyll will, under otherwise equal conditions, always be faster than something built on a database, regardless of what you're doing under the server's hood.

Caching will help, though. Your mileage may vary, but using WP Rocket (in our experience the best WordPress caching plugin) gains us a whopping 43 points on the work production site over the cacheless staging server.

### Use a well-configured server (or configure it yourself)

Google take an aggressive attitude to squeezing as much performance out of assets and caching as possible. This site is hosted by Github Pages and, as such, enjoys a <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> and CSS, HTML and javascript minimising with zero configuration.

### Serve web fonts asynchronously with javascript
