title: elemetary OS &#8211; a quick review
---

I work on an old, bottom of the range, 4 year old Toshiba laptop boasting 2MB of RAM. It came with Windows 7, which slowed to a crawl after about a year, and I'd installed Linux Mint to dual boot.

It started wheezing and creeking. So I wiped everything and installed lightweight Lubuntu, and it ran really well. But Lubuntu was a little cranky and looks like it was made in 1995 (not actually such a bad thing), so I've installed a supposedly lightweight, far more attractive Debian&#8211;based OS called elementary.

I've been using elementary for about a week. Here are my initial thoughts:

## The good

### It's fairly sexy

Which is good going for the Linux world. elementary is obviously based on OS X, but it sports a few minor differences.

The top bar isn't quite the same as OS X's. In OS X, the bar will change depending on the app you're running; in elementary it's always the same, displaying a simple application launcher, the time and date and a limited toolbar (wifi, volume, battery etc.) Apps have their own toolbars, just as they do in Windows.

I prefer elementary's approach as I always got in a bit of muddle switching between apps in OS X. I like my UI predictable.

Like OS X, you can't reposition the dock. The icons are flatter and plainer, which I prefer. OS X's look, well, a bit tacky, with all the reflections and animations.

### It doesn't make you think

elementary has followed Apple's lead in limiting the number of options you can tweak. The designers explain why in the extensive design guidelines:

> If possible, completely avoid presenting any settings or configuration in your app. Providing settings is usually an easy way out of making design decisions about an app's behavior. But just like with problems of feature bloat, settings mean more code, more bugs, more testing, more documentation, and more complexity. <cite><a href="http://elementaryos.org/docs/human-interface-guidelines/avoid-configuration">elementary Human Interface Guidelines&#8212;Avoid configuration</a></cite>

This is a very un&#8211;Linux approach, and it'd be interesting to see how hardened Linuxers (_hardliners_?) find elementary. I liked it a lot; any OS that makes _good_ decisions for you will improve your experience simply by getting out of the way. elementary looks and _feels_ light.

elementary even ships with some custom made, simple, well designed apps. I prefer Geary, the email client, to Thunderbird, simply because it gives messages in the message list some room to breath.

### It's fairly fast

Lubuntu spoiled me. It uses the xfce desktop, which is very plain and very fast.

elementary's not slow, but Lubuntu made me notice any kind of lag, and the fan has started whirring aggressively again. On the other hand, it's not go and make a cup of tea while the desktop paints Windows 7 speed.

## The bad

### It's made some bad choices

The other side of the avoid presenting settings coin is that you can't change things. On the whole, this is a very good thing, but there are some defaults which need work.

The system font is a too small to my eyes Droid Sans. Droid Sans is _OK_, but nothing more, and there are better, free fonts out there. See what Kirby has done with Source Sans Pro:

<p class="figcaption">The Kirby panel uses Source Sans Pro, a far better choice for a UI interface than Droid Sans</p>

The fact that I can't change the system font size isn't a problem <i>per se</i>, it's just that it is very small (I'd guess it's 11 pixels). Droid Sans is quite a large font, but it becomes indistinct in elementary.

### Linux glitches

As with any Linux distro, expect oddness. I've installed elementary on two machines and, for some reason, the custom text editor (called Scratch) has disappeared. Or rather, it's still in the Applications menu but it just doesn't open. Why this should have happened I have absolutely no idea. It's one of those Linux things you come to accept, but other operating systems couldn't get away with. You can, of course, install another text editor.

## Summary

I like elementary a lot. I installed the latest version, called Luna, which is 14 months old now. A new version's around the corner &#8211; it'll be interesting to see how things improve. I'd happily recommend it as a usable, everyday OS, and have no plans to return to Lubuntu.

One further note: elementary is currently built on Ubuntu 12.04, rather than 14.04. You might want to bear that in mind before installing if you're coming from a newer Ubuntu variant.
