I’m referring to [this article about… well, what _exactly_ it’s about I’m not sure](http://www.goodlibraryguide.com/blog/archives/2013/06/amazon_and_goog.html), but it's a superlative 167 words.

9 killer techniques in 167 words (91 fewer than I could manage talking about it):
	
* Contentious title and opening. Your first reaction when you read it? Probably _Never!_
* Short, active sentences and paragraphs.
* Reference to powerful, controversial brand names (the library world both admires and fears Amazon and Google).
* Judicious use of ‘we’.
* Facts and figures (£1000 million).
* A triple (*politicians*, *council officers and library professionals*).
* Emotive language (*lunacy*, *deserves to be shut down*).
* A counter example (*America*).
* A call to action (*we should stop it*).

Unsurprisingly, several people commented.

But read it again, and a few gaps appear:
	
* _Legal tax evasion_ is an oxymoron that comes from the writer's attempt to resolve several contradictory ideas. Should Google and Amazon be allowed to dodge tax – not that they did dodge tax, of course – in order to save taxpayers money?
* The America example is intriguing but not outlined in _any_ detail at all.
* In the same vein, _how_ has Google provided a better information service? One sentence would do.
* Churches weren’t built for meeting in; they were built for praying in. It’s a bad example but not surprising because there simply isn’t another space that fulfils the same civic function as a library.

I _love_ this style of writing, and it sharpens up your thinking even if you don’t agree with the opinion it expresses. But just a little detail would make it less easy to dismiss after a second reading.
