Sometimes you come across a website that just seems _right_.  I'm currently leafing through various pages for inspiration; a potential client has said he likes my simple style, so I'm thinking of something _really_ simple for him.  Anyway, I'm getting inspiration from [rainfall daffinson](http://rainfall-daffinson.com/):

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="Rainfall and Daffison - a large heading and a list of clients, all rendered in big Times"]![Rainfall and Daffison - a large heading and a list of clients, all rendered in big Times](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3161/2821337340_3f24100bf5_o.gif)[/caption]

Where to start on the brilliance of this design?  The simplicity and self-evidence of the idea (a list of clients the designer has worked with), the confidence to be this simple, the appreciation of what visitors are looking for from a site or the relevance and clarity of the choices offered?

Of course, it helps when the client list is this impressive.  But still.

And Times New Roman rendered properly on the web (i.e. at a _minimum_ of 24 pixels).
