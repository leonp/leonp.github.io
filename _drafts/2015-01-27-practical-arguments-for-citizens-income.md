title: Arguing for Citizens Income and some practical ways to make it happen

Politics _feels_ like it's changed this week. On Sunday night Greece elected a left (not _centre_ left) party to power while earlier in the day Green Party leader [Natalie Bennett chatted with Andrew Neil about the Citizens Income (CI) on the BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dFn8RIXOBE&t=4m20s).

It's a shame Bennett made such a pig's ear of explaining the policy, but at least it's gone vaguely mainstream. More people are talking about it &#8211; and that means more criticism.

Dawn Foster expressed some concerns in [an article for <cite>Vice</cite>](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/citizens-income-would-it-work-dawn-foster-498). I don't agree with all her (or Donald Hirsch's) arguments, but at least people are discussing CI rather than dismissing it out of hand.

If we take [a properly argued case for CI](http://www.citizensincome.org/), we can answer some of the points in the article and think of ways to get CI taken seriously.

## Free money isn't really free

The fact that a CI _might_ mean higher taxes for richer people is hardly an objection, or, if it is, it's based on a peculiarly rightwing, austere logic.

Similarly, not spending money on something else (the Green party suggests Trident) doesn't make it wrong. A lot of people may well argue Trident is a waste of money. Spending priorities change over time.

Hirsch claims CI isn't revenue neutral. If that's true (and Malcolm Torry would argue differently) it doesn't make it a non&#8211;starter.

## London is more expensive than Middlesboro

&pound;72 a week will go a lot further on Teeside than by the Thames, but that's true whether it's &pound;72 income support or CI. A realistic CI can't solve _every_ social problem, and the fact that London is so expensive is a symptom of lots of other things.

Work benefits and state pensions aren't adjusted according to where you live. Under the Citizens Income Trust's proposals, CI simply replaces existing work benefits and pensions. If we're serious about CI, it has to tackle a clear set of problems, not every ill going.

## Rich people get free money

Yes, the queen gets a CI, as do a myriad of unlikeable rich people (take your pick of wealthy bogeymen &#8211; I'll go for Richard Branson). But as Chris Dillow puts it, [this is a feature, not a bug](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/01/basic-income-some-issues.html).

CI is cheap to run &#8211; there's no means testing. All the state does is make a monthly payment. There are no job centre interviews or insane sanctions for minor infractions. This is a very good thing.

Administrative savings would help fund CI. We spend billions every year on a poverty industry.

And because _everyone_ gets it, no&#8211;one can complain about scroungers. It's inherently cohesive and democratic in the same way as child benefit.

## 70 quid a week is nothing

It's true that no&#8211;one can live on 70 quid week. So unless you propose a CI of around &pound;300, there's no way it can replace _all_ benefits.

This is a valid criticism. It's easy to portray CI as a panacea for all our problems, but if we propose a realistic amount then it only tackles some of them. Housing is a vast, separate problem, and until we have lots of affordable homes, we're stuck with housing benefit.

Similarly, we can't rely on employers' largesse or the market to ensure decent wages. Although the right could argue a CI obviates the need for a minimum wage, it can't exist in a vacuum.

## Positioning Citizens Income

These criticisms make us look at what a realistic CI can do, and &#8211; if we still believe it's a good idea &#8211; how we can get the agrument across.

The idea that left and right can unite over CI is too simplistic.

CI can only happen if it's pitched at a low level. That means we need to drop the freedom from worry, let's all become artists rhetoric when we're talking to the unconvinced.

Instead, we need to concentrate on specific problems, probably by pitching it as an alternative to the current work benefit regime. Now, if we're feeling cynical we can even indulge in a little populist _hardworking_ rhetoric here. We could argue CI:

- simplifies a vast, wasteful bureacracy
- makes it easier to move from unemployment into work

Small steps and all that. In the same way Syriza became seen as a practical response to the real problem of austerity rather than a Trotskyist/Maoist/Eurocommunist coalition, perhaps CI can become a sensible, mainstream policy.
