As it's been a whole 3 months or so since the last redesign, I thought it was high time to spend hours communing with the laptop and toiling over PHP functions. I have redesigned the blog.


### Features:





	
  * Integration of Gravatars and bookmarks. I've kind of resisted them before — I'm not exactly sure why — but they add a bit of warmth to the design.

	
  * Readability. I've kept a 100% font size (most likely 16 pixels) for body copy, and the traditional blue link colour. Measure and leading are all spick and span. I've got over justifying paragraphs.

	
  * A logo. Of sorts. I'm not very graphical, so I thought I'd have a go at a creating a logo out of plain HTML and CSS. Not quite [Jon Tan level wizardry](http://jontangerine.com/log/2007/11/complex-type-css-fix-cleartype-miss), but I'm pretty happy with it. And it adds colour.

	
  * A grid. This one's based on ems: three 17em columns with 3em margins. I've [written somewhat immodestly about grids](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/05/why-use-grids/) in the past, and I still think the reliance on _complex_ grids as an answer to poorly structured content is a bad thing, but I may revisit this subject.

	
  * Twitter and Delicious. Not sure about this.


This theme was created over a period of about a week, in the company of my two children. The templates were built in 10 minute bursts, sandwiched by feeding, changing and reading. It's an odd way to work, but actually quite enjoyable.

As ever, your comments are more than welcome.
