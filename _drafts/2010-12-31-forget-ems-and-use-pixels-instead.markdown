My brain melted when I attempted to add a border to an article _and_ its heading using ems. This wasn't helped by my decision to use a [unitless line height](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/). I _think_ I managed to do it _and_ maintain a vertical rhythm, but it was hard work.

So [I've decided to reâ€“revert after all](http://leonpaternoster.com/2010/12/why-its-still-worth-using-ems-instead-of-pixels/). It took about 5 seconds using pixels, and the fact that this blog's body copy is set at 16 pixels automatically makes it more accessible than 95% of other websites. True, it won't respect any user overrides, but who bothers to reset their base font size anyway? Why not make the text big and readable to start with?

Oh, and a happy new year!
