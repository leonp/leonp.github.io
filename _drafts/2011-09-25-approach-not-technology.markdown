I really, erm, love how I Love Typography sets some of its articles. Take [this piece on ATypI 2011 Reykjav√≠k](http://ilovetypography.com/2011/09/25/atypi-2011-reykjavik/): a part white, part blue screen and some wide images with right aligned captions:

What strikes me is that this could have been designed 10 years ago. No CSS3 or javascript effects required. IE6 could handle the layout.

Yet it's highly unlikely this page would have existed 10 years ago. Designers were constrained by their use of certain layouts and font sizes, or even the desire to make web pages look like they were doing something _special_. The _approach_ was different.

In fact, you still don't see this type of design much today. You don't _need_ animations, fades and box shadows to make attractive web pages.
