  * [Buy Scherzo 3.3](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes)

	
  * [See the demo site](http://leonpaternoster.com/scherzo)


Yesterday I released the latest version of my WordPress theme (find out [more about Scherzo](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes)).

Changes:



	
  * changed heading and secondary text font to [Source Sans Pro](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) (using an enqueued stylesheet in `functions.php`)

	
  * upped font size to 112.5% at widescreens.This means paragraphs will (in all likelihood) display at 18 pixels. The header image will need to be bigger as well (namely 1008 pixels minimum)

	
  * fixed an encoding bug in the template files which caused some hosts to reject the theme

	
  * fixed right align bug

	
  * increased spacing between main col and sidebar

	
  * columns defined as % rather than pixels (this will result in some changes to your column widths)


Any questions, just get in touch or leave a comment.
