It worked very well before the internet came along, and there's no reason why it shouldn't continue to work now.

Almost all younger websites spurn the idea of charging a fee for anything, and perhaps that's a great idea for some of them. But it isn't always going to work for everyone. Charging a fee creates a contract, a relationship. Flickr says: "You pay us money, and we will give you a useful space to do cool things with your photos."

Oh and, since you said you liked ChocoSnacks, we're going to show other people an advert that uses a photo of you and a link to ChocoSnacks. Cool? Cool."

**There's a difference** between freely disseminating knowledge and charging for a service. That makes sense to me (which is just as well as I charge 20 quid for my Scherzo theme). There's something honest about a simple contract.





But distinguishing between a service and some knowledge isn't always easy. Where would you place news? And how do you pay those journalists? Do you want to rely on the largesse of wealthy benefactors?
