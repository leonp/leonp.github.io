There&#8217;s an interesting thread over on the TWTD message board discussing [subscriptions and advertising][1].

This is an old argument, but still important. I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s managed to answer the question: *how do I make a living from my news website*? or, at the very least, *how do I cover my news website costs*?

The TWTD admins serve old school, flashing ads, which they argue are the only way to bring in revenue. They therefore ask site visitors to whitelist TWTD.<figure class="figure alignnone">

This strikes me as an absurd business model. We rely on users to let us annoy them a bit rather than ask them for an upfront payment. And then we admonish them when they block the stuff that makes it difficult to read our content.

Obviously, news sites struggle with revenue. But there has to be a better approach than serving crap adverts. What are the possible alternatives?

*   *Charge for content*. The site admins are adamant this won&#8217;t work after experimenting with this several years ago. I think I agree: we&#8217;re fickle when it comes to paying for news online on a regular basis.
*   *Charge for premium content* – to the message board, for example. There&#8217;s a large, hardcore user base that may well be willing to pay for their message board fix.
*   *Ask for donations*. The Wikipedia and Mozilla approach (although Mozilla is largely funded by Google). TWTD is well respected and liked among Town fans, some of whom may be willing to dip into their pockets occasionally.
*   *Apply for funding*. TWTD is a valued community asset (to use the lingo). I would imagine it gets a lot more visits than the official ITFC website or the EADT and Ipswich Star.
*   *Serve better designed adverts*. Part of the problem is the likes of [Tribal Fusion][2] have been serving the same gaudy, intrusive Flash ads for over a decade. Compare these with [The Deck&#8217;s offering][3] (admittedly aimed at hipster designers, but there&#8217;s no reason why we can&#8217;t benefit from pleasant looking ads everywhere).<figure class="figure alignnone">

The final approach seems promising. After all, we&#8217;re far more likely to click on a simple, relevant, well designed advert than [Ray Winstone&#8217;s gurning face][4].
