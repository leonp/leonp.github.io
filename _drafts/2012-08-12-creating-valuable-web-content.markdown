**Noted:** [Content: A Blessing, A Bubble, A Burden](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/07/content-blessing-bubble-burden/), a fantastic Smashing Magazine post by [Christopher Butler](http://www.newfangled.com/chris_butler_blog).





There is a ton of stuff about writing worthwhile content in this article. I heartily recommend sending it to your preferred reading device.





I liked the point Christopher made about reading in order to become a good writer, but this rang especially true for me:

> Writing, especially, is difficult to do well and often. As discussed earlier, it requires a level of focus and investment that sometimes comes into direct conflict with the job youâ€™d rather do, whether that is design or something else. One solution may be to employ dedicated writers, but few marketing teams have that luxury.

Until July this year I was web editor at a small, not for profit organisation. The role covered a _lot_ of work, including website maintenance, project management, running the social media accounts and building microsites. Often the writing was pushed to the back of the queue by pressing deadlines, or stuff I preferred to do, such as building websites.





Perhaps the greatest problem I faced was working in a kind of content vacuum. Because I was the web guy my colleagues delegated _all_ things web to me, including content planning and writing.





It's impossible to plan and produce content that demonstrates the organisation's expertise without the input of your organisation's experts. It won't happen by osmosis.





If you are the web guy I think you have to do two things to do your job well. First, make sure you keep writing at the forefront of your job. And, more importantly, get your experts invloved in your content. In short, you need to increase the value of content in your organisation.





All on top of MySQL, PHP and managing projects. It's not an easy job.
