Oddly enough, I've missed out on the [property owning democracy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/06/margaret-thatcher-britains-obsession-property-right-to-buy) (a strange conflation, no?) established by Thatcher in the 1980s. While friends' fathers (and it was always dads) bought their council houses for about half their real value, when property wasn't worth a fraction of what it's worth now, we moved between rented houses paid for by my grandad or, when my mum moved in with an ex-public school boy, his dad's shitty rental.

My grandparents -- working class Conservative party members -- laughably refused to live in a council house, so never had the chance to buy one for next to nothing.

No father in my life to buy a council house, so no owned property.

Meanwhile, those initial council house purchases are now worth what in terms of assets owned by older people? A quite incredible return, probably more than an entire life's salary and pension. The asset _is_ the pension, to be drawn down on in old age for exotic holidays, new cars, more property assets etc. etc.

When I worked in London in the 1990s to the 2000s our Greenwich landlord offered us our [Caradoc Street](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Caradoc+St,+London+SE10+9AG/@51.4858782,0.0006793,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47d8a827a8e72e83:0x41c9f43bbeda48dd!8m2!3d51.4858782!4d0.0028733) rental for &pound;180,000. We couldn't afford the deposit, and missed out on a property now worth around &pound;600,000. I know several London folk who sold up and bought very nice houses in Suffolk and Ipswich with the profits. <i>Sans</i> mortgage and rent.

Recently, I halfowned a house with a housing association on a crowded, non-designed, modern estate. By a stroke of luck I made a fair bit of money when I sold up earlier this year, but we still can't afford to buy. So I'm renting again.

Renting is horrible. Houses are invariably bodged up by landlords extracting the maximum amount of money for the minimum investment. If they can avoid paying a professional and do work themselves, they will. This is the land of the DIYer. Consequently, things fall apart regularly: ceilings, bathroom floors, handles, hot water, ill-fitting doors, poorly plumbed sinks and overflow pipes. Anything and everything.

Estate agents administer on behalf of these faceless landlords, chucking "difficult" tenants out who have the nerve to ask for things to be fixed, making use of a perfectly legal, two month "break clause" after a six month term. Of course, they need to make their money too, and the costs are passed on to the tenant wherever possible. The customer in this unholy trinity is the landlord, not the tenant, who exists solely to pay money to the landlord and the middleman.

So, you'll be charged: A checkout fee, a tenancy fee, a check-in fee, an inventory fee, a reference fee (for each adult) and one and a half months' deposit. You'll pay a month's rent in advance. Your rent will increase regularly, in line with "market" rates. The estate agent will insist you steam clean the carpets, and get the oven professionally cleaned (probably by companies they insist on) when you leave the house. Moving costs around &pound;500, if you pack everything yourself. You'll lose a bit of your deposit too, because.

So the only rational answer to _rent or own?_ is own, because you won't be fleeced on a regular basis for the privilege of living somewhere. And your kids won't go through the same miserable experience.

But. What if rents were a sane amount, deposits reasonable and tenancies secure? What if your rented house would pass on to your children? What if your landlord fixed the property when things broke? What if your landlord wasn't a private individual? What if you didn't have to deal with estate agents?

Then the question becomes one of _ownership_. I suspect lots of people want to own a property, but I'm not sure why. [An Englishman's home](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/an-englishmans-home-is-his-castle.html) and similar reactionary bullshit. If you -- and your children -- don't have to worry about where you live and you don't exist to simply fund a private individual's wealth, why own a house? Isn't ownership simply a burden?
