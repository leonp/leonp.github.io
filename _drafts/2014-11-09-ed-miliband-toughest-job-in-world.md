title: Ed Miliband has the hardest job in the world

<cite>The Observer</cite> reports twitchily on a mini&#8211;putsch to oust Ed Miliband. Lots of unnamed shadow ministers apparently, shadily, are itching to anoint _man of the people_ Alan Johnson leader. The thinking is that this will assure the party a solid majority at the next election.

Is Ed Miliband doing a good or bad job? I'm largely undecided, but I do think it's the hardest job in the world. Consider:

- He's leading a party that had lost it's way under Blair and then Gordon Brown's disastrous leadership
- Like all large political parties, Labour is a broad church. But circumstances have conspired to make juggling the needs of its factions especially difficult.
- The Loony Left (that's me, incidentally) think we should be heading in a more radical direction. Some of use even back utterly unrealistic policies like a basic income. The time _seems_ right for us post&#8211;2008.
- The Blairite right hearkens back to a time when people liked a political leader and Labour was able to appeal to a middle ground.
- The financial crisis and expenses scandal served to ensure people don't like any politicians.
- The party can't depend on its core vote because said Blairite faction has ignored it for decades. The UKIP and, more threateningly, the SNP have benefited.

What's a wonk to do?

Ed Jr _has_ formulated some reasonably radical, coherent policies.
