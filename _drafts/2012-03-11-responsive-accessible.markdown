I had drafted a longer post on this subject which looked at a website that froze my 4 year old [Nokia N78](http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-n78). But I need to get my facts right before publishing. Anyway, the basic point was this: A responsive layout is good but if your site freezes anything but high spec, modern mobile devices because you serve 300k of javascript with every page you're only part of the way there.

Making your site work on a range of mobile devices is the new accessibility battleground. What's a fair and realistic approach? Do we assume everyone is using a relatively capable device?

And if you're serving the same HTML, javascript, CSS and images to each and every phone, tablet and desktop will you have to compromise your desktop site?
