The winter fuel allowance, the shortest waiting times in history, crime down by a third, the creation of SureStart, the cancer guarantee, record results in schools, more students than ever, the Disability Discrimination Act, devolution, civil partnerships, peace in Northern Ireland, the social chapter, half a million children out of poverty, maternity pay, paternity leave, child benefit at record levels, the minimum wage, the ban on cluster bombs, the cancelling of debt, the trebling of aid, the first-ever Climate Change Act.

OK, so a couple of these maybe stretch the definition of _achievement_, but I've personally benefited from four of them: four things I and my family wouldn't have got (and will probably lose) under the Tories.

[So The Sun defected](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2663454/Labour-upset-at-The-Sun-after-newspaper-withdraws-support.html) (although it's clearly been anti-Brown for months anyway) after the speech. But, interestingly enough, it could argue against only one of the above (apparently the UK lives in a perpetual state of violent anarchy). True to type, it also declared immigration is “out of control” (zzzzzzzzzzz…)

Q: what percentage of Sun readers claim tax credits? Benefit from the minimum wage?
