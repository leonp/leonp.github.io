I say ‘no, delete's enough’, iA says ‘[yes, please](http://twitter.com/iA/status/22513827317)’ while Manuel says ‘[let's have no buttons](http://twitter.com/manuelmartensen/status/22522434022)’.

Ignoring the [implementation problems](http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2010/08/29/does-twitter-need-an-edit-tweet-button/), I think part of the charm of Twitter is its _un–advertising_. The brevity, immediacy and capacity to misspell or misphrase something are all part of this charm. True, I'm sure vast marketing departments prepare keyword–laden tweets months in advance, but the general tone is still pretty informal.

But they are our missives, so we should retain the right to delete them if we want to. Without a delete button we'd be just a tiny bit more wary when we tweet.
