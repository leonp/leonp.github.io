**Of course**, consistency isn't a _bad_ thing in and of itself. It can reassure website visitors and help them find things on your website.





But you need to be careful when you're trying to achieve consistency across different media. When I was a web editor the consistency argument was used to make everyone in the marketing team use the same set of images across print and web. So the creative agency would come up with a series of concepts on a big set of cards and I'd be expected to base a design around whatever visual we thought looked nice. They _might_ work in  a print ad, but I'd get requests like _Can you make sure the top of the page includes an image of a signpost._





This is not the way to build websites. There are many reasons why decorative images don't work on the web (see [point 55 of Nielsen's home page guidelines](http://www.useit.com/homepageusability/guidelines.html)), so you can't just slot your marketing concepts into your web pages:

> Some types of pictures are completely ignored. This is typically the case for big feel-good images that are purely decorative. [Photos as Web Content](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/photo-content.html)
>

**I suspect** the greatest challenge web managers face in some organisations is getting colleagues to recognise that the web is a different beast from what they're used to. You can't just buy a bunch of email addresses or advertising keywords, send out a mailshot or buy a campaign and expect the customers to come knocking at the door.





In other words you can't _persuade_ people to buy your product or think something about you through advertising and imagery, just as you can't set type and images in the same way you would in a magazine. If your organisation doesn't get this, you're facing a struggle.





However, you can achieve consistency across media through your use of typeface, language and colour. Just make sure you don't end up using 10 point type because that's what the magazine uses. Still, I guess that's better than uploading an 'interactive' PDF to your website.
