[Get the latest version of Scherzo](http://leonpaternoster.com/wp-themes/).

As I've had quite a few emails asking about the next version of Scherzo recently, I thought I'd give you a progress update.

Firstly, you can [view the latest development version](http://dev.leonpaternoster.com/scherzo) to get an idea of what it'll look like and how it will work.

Next: Scherzo 3 will cost. I'm thinking of charging £10–15 and various support options.

The only things that need finishing (I think) are:



	
  * making it translation ready

	
  * navigation dropdowns at widescreen resolution


I may add some other bits and pieces.

Progress is slow because I moved house this month. Moving house is not fun. Never move.

Any questions, just leave them in the comments.
