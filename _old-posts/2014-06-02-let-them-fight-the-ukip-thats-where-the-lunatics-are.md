> Overall, Ukip has not so much won new friends as polarised public opinion. Ukip did better this time at turning diminishing approval into votes, but it also alienated far more of the electorate. Millions more voters now regard Ukip negatively than in 2009, and fewer decline to take sides. <cite><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/02/five-myths-ukip-conservatives-farage-newark">Five myths about Ukip… that should make the Conservatives happy</a></cite>

Driving into [Mildenhall][1] a couple of weeks ago, I was greeted by the thoroughly depressing sight of a huge *Vote UKIP* billboard. As if to say *you’re entering UKIP country now, boy*.

The UKIP, as I will now always call them, won Suffolk in the Euro elections, but they didn’t win one seat in the Ipswich council elections.

The UKIP polarises, and it’s worth remembering most the country doesn’t think like lumbering racists in blazers. The general election won’t be won in Mildenhall, but in towns like Ipswich.

Let’s say the Tories attempt to fight the election on the UKIP’s territory. That’s good for Labour – they&#8217;ll become the *de facto* party of the centre.
