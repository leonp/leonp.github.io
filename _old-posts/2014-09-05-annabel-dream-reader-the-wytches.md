In the tradition of a slightly more famous blogger, I'm sharing my Friday night listening. (More Friday afternoon really, as the kids are still up watching <cite>You've Been Framed</cite>. I know, I have failed my parenting.)

So, <cite>[Annabel Dream Reader](http://heavenlyemporium.greedbag.com/buy/annabel-dream-reader-1/)</cite> ([don't buy it from Amazon](/2014/09/amazon-service-conundrum/), obviously), the debut album from Peterborough's (now Brighton's) The Wytches. It's an echoey, rough and ready surf rock album, with a nice gothic inflection. The singer shrieks beautifully, the drum and bass pound artlessly and the guitars riff or pick out slow Dick Dale solos. I like it a lot.

Sounds a bit like Pixies (mainly through the Joey Santiago&#8211;esque guitar) and a bit more like The Fall of the 2000s onwards. Both share the 50s, surf rock vibe, as well as an occult weirdness. The Wytches' guitar often reminds me of <cite>Hittite Man</cite>, and the delay effects on <cite>Burn out the Bruise</cite> sound like <cite>Mike's Love Xexagon</cite>. Then again, I always hear The Fall in music.

There's also some heavier, Black Sabbath riffing. This is _always_ a good thing.

The songs are about &#8211; well, I'm not sure. Lots of girls, boys, love and some desperation. I really liked the vocalist's wailing; very spooky.

First listen impression: very cool, original and fun. Baroque surfer rock with an occult twist. Buy.
