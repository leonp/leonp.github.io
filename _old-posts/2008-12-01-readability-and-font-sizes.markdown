Preliminary notes for an article:

What is a 'good' font size for reading from a screen?  Lots of variables:

- screen size/resolution
- age/eyesight of viewer
- length of paragraph
- measure of paragraph
- reader's taste

I've always assumed that larger font size = more readable, but having read [Vivien's critique of my website](http://www.inspirationbit.com/design-critique-leon-paternoster), [comments on the iA site](http://informationarchitects.jp/100e2r/) and through listening to my work colleagues, I'm not so sure.

Can anyone point to any research on this?

Does the font type (serif vs. sans) have any effect?  I _think_ that Georgia at 16px looks great and reads great, am willing to admit that helvetica/arial (and sans in general) not so much.

Congruence of taste and readability - emotional aspect?

Possible cop out - respect the user's setting by specifying `font-size: 100%, p {font-size: 1em;}`.  Except - how many people actually change this setting.  Do you know any normal, non-geek people who do this?  Are there any stats on this?

Any pointers, ideas etc. welcome.
