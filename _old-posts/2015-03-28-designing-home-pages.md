Home pages are difficult to get right. A good starting point would be to find out who's visiting your home page, and for what purpose. That's a big piece of work, but at Suffolk Libraries it's people who:

- want to find, reserve and/or reserve books
- want to find/contact a branch
- want to find out about a mobile library
- have a question about how to use the service
- want to join the library

In an ideal world **the service you offer would exactly meet your users' requirements**. That sounds simple (ha!), but it's not. We don't live in an ideal world:

- The service you offer might be restricted by the resources you have to provide it
- Your stakeholders' vision of the service might not be the same as users' requirements
- You don't know your users' requirements
- You don't know how to meet your users' requirements
- Your users' _real_ requirements have become muddied by the substandard service you've offered them in the past. Similarly, you've lost lots of potential users and only a small, niche subset remains
- Your users aren't aware of how your service works and everything it has to offer

You can overcome some of these problems. Armed with a strategy, you have a readymade, agreed&#8211;on set of reasons for the (hopefully) right decisions you've made. You can also get better at building useful services, or you can hire the right people.

Some you can't. We live in insanely austere times. Or maybe you don't have full control over all your web stuff.

The point is: this is complex stuff. That's why, as users, we're so often frustrated by websites.
