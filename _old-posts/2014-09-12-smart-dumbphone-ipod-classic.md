I was bad and didn't get to blog yesterday so I'm going to cheat and give this post yesterday's date. Don't tell anyone.

What I wish I'd written yesterday was this <a href="http://www.abccopywriting.com/2014/09/12/why-i-loved-the-ipod-classic">farewell to the iPod Classic</a>, which Apple quietly dropped from its store this week (although you can still buy the <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/ipod-nano/">Nano</a>, which does the same job albeit with a lot less storage &#8211; how long that has, who knows).

No one _needs_ a phone that plays music, or a watch that connects to your phone &#8211; having Twitter, Facebook, music, phone calls and email all in one place creates notification noise, and a constant, twitchy switching between apps.

The corollary of the iPod Classic would be a touchscreen dumb phone that just did calls and SMS really well. No apps, not even a visible <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. It wouldn't be tied to a particular network or software manufacturer.

I always thought this would be a solid idea, and I'd be first in the queue for one (although no camping out beforehand). But obviously I'm in a minority of nearly one: most of you seem to want everything, all the time.
