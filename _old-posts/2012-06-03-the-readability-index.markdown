**If you design long form texts** for the web your readers shouldn't sigh or wince when they open one of your articles.

One of the finest inventions of the digital age is [Readability](http://www.readability.com/). Press the red sofa icon and _voila_! no more ads, dark backgrounds or tiny text. It can even send articles to your Kindle.

Of course, we shouldn't need Readability, but it does provide a clear way of evaluating how well you've designed a web page. If your reader clicks the icon then you've failed. There's even a formula we could use, something like _number of page views divided by number of times the page is sent to Readability_. Forget likes, retweets and Dribble: A readability index.
