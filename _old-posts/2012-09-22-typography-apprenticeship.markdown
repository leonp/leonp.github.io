I sometimes think about a web typography apprenticeship, especially when I'm fiddling around with blog themes at the weekend. The fiddling involves lots of repetition.





Inflexible and completely prescriptive, it'd take five years of building simple websites that focused on the basics of scale, proportion and tone. Font size, relative scaling and colour.





Imagine the benefits: Beautiful, perfectly constructed websites for readers and a set of superuseful skills for the apprentices. And if you build websites, imagine being able to draw on a set of skills that had become second nature through repetition, the _ease_ with which you'd begin a project.





Eagleeyed readers will have noted that I am not writing about work.
