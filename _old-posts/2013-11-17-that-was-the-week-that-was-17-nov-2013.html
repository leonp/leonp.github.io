title: That was the week that was&thinsp;&#8212;&thinsp;17 November 2013

This might be a weekly series. It may well not. Anyway, here's what I liked on the web over the last week:

<dl>

<dt><a href="http://gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/when-tiny-task-important-organization">When a tiny task is important to the organization</a>

<dd>Gerry McGovern explains how a task that's important to the organisation but not the customer should be designed.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://fvsch.com/words/">Florent's words page</a></dt>

<dd>Florent's kind of word cloud. Very smart, and it all looks smashing, of course.</dd>

<dt><a href="blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/37699">Welfare and labour market conflicts have made it increasingly difficult for Europeâ€™s centre-left parties to survive as &#8216;catch all&#8217; movements</a></dt>

<dd>Pithily titled piece on why the left's finding it so difficult at the moment. Depressing, but worth reading.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://nowthenmagazine.com/issue-68/basic-income/">Basic Income. Restructuring the economy</a></dt>

<dd>Really clear summary of what a Basic Income is and does.</dd>

<dt><a href="www.dorisandbertie.com/goodcopybadcopy/2013/11/12/13-arguments-to-try-next-time-someone-accuses-you-of-dumbing-down-and-1-you-should-avoid">13 arguments to try next time someone accuses you of dumbing down (and 1 you should avoid)</a></dt>

<dd>Why short, to the point copy is good for you and your readers. In contrast to the beautiful but flatulent <a href="http://www.holtzbrinck.com/">Holtzbrinck Publishing Group website</a>.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://37signals.com/svn/posts/3683-microsofts-dystopian-pitch-for-remote-work">Microsoft's dystopian pitch for remote work</a></dt>

<dd>Why Microsoft's new Office ad campaign is a horrible invocation to work when you shouldn't be working.</dd>
