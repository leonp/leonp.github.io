title: Why justify?

[Firefox 6 and Safari 5 now hyphenate](http://blog.fontdeck.com/post/9037028497/hyphens). In theory this means that you can now [justify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(typesetting)) blocks of text so they'll look like the neat, square paragraphs in most (all?) printed novels, _sans_ the [rivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_(typography)) that `text-align: justify` normally generates.

Leaving aside the fact that justification still doesn't work that well on the web, I'm scratching my head as to _why_ you'd really want to do it. True, it _looks_ a little neater than left aligned text, but I can't see any readability benefits (quite the opposite). Words are meant to be read, not just looked at.

I'd guess that justification works in print because its a lot easier to fine tune spacing and therefore hyphenation. And there's no chrome to distract you from the text itself. But neither apply to web pages.
