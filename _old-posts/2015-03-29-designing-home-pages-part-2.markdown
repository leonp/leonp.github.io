In the first note I discussed [the difficulties in providing users with an easy way to do whatever it is they want to do online](/2015/03/designing-home-pages/). This time I'll look at how you choose what to actually put on your home page.

At [Suffolk Libraries](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk) our customers' top tasks are:

- find, reserve and/or reserve books
- find/contact a branch
- find out about a mobile library
- find out how to use the service
- join the library

The purpose of the home page is to allow users to perform these tasks as quickly as possible. It's important you keep this goal in mind when you're showing stakeholders your work &#8211; when they're looking at the page they're not trying to do something, they just want to be impressed. That's one reason why sliders are so popular.

(Side note: kill two birds with one stone and get stakeholders involved in testing your home page. That'll get them to use your home page properly.)

Your top task list is your design's starting point, but you'll also need to consider your navigation. If you've done your card sorts properly and have a clearly labelled, logical navigation, users will head to that instinctively.

Consequently, avoid putting a task in both your main navigation and on your home page as you'll ask your users to make a decision as to which is the correct link to click. Instead, link to popular, deeper content in the home page area.

For example, _find a branch_ is a popular task on our website, but we also have a _Branches_ link in our navigation menu. In the home page area we link directly to the main library branches rather than the same _Branches_ page:

<div class="row clearfix">

	<figure class="g-w-col1-2 g-w-left">
	
		<h2>Navigation menu</h2>
		
		<p><img src="/images/navigation.png" class="centre" alt="Screenshot of the Suffolk Libraries navigation menu"></p>
		
		<figcaption class="figcaption">Suffolk Libraries navigation menu</figcaption>
		
	</figure>
	
	<figure class="g-w-col1-2 g-w-left g-w-last">
	
		<h2>Home content area</h2>
		
		<p><img src="/images/branches.png" class="centre" alt="Screenshot of part of the Suffolk Libraries home page"></p>
		
		<figcaption class="figcaption">Home page links to deeper, popular content</figcaption>
		
	</figure>
	
</div>

Ideally, you'd be able to do all the top tasks on the home page, which would mean a nice large search box with which to find whatever it is you're looking for.

Unfortunately, the library catalogue is separate from the website, so the home page's main task is to simply ferry users off elsewhere. Still, the goal is to make their task as easy as possible, rather than generate page views, so that's fine (although a bit odd when you have to report on website page views).

<figure>
		
<p><img src="/images/home-panel.png" class="centre" alt="Screenshot of the main panel on the Suffolk Libraries home page"></p>
		
<figcaption class="figcaption">Sometimes you just need to send users off elsewhere</figcaption>

</figure>

_When to stop?_ How far do you go down your top task list? What makes a task important? This is something I've struggled with in the past; it's easy to let design elements (a grid of images, for example) dictate the content you promote to the home page.

Your analytics will tell you the obvious important user tasks &#8211; they tend to be the prosaic jobs. Ignore these at your peril. But the more tasks you add to a page, the harder you make it to interpret, so I'm tempted to say stop at that point. However, I'm beginning to look at breaking top tasks down into smaller components, and at ways of helping users to make decisions beyond finding a simple link.

Your home page should, I think, only cover a handful of top tasks. The second goal is to give these tasks a bit more meaning to the user. That's what I'll discuss in the next part of this series.
