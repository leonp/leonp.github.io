Today's (fairly scientifically/sweetly named) kiosk testing revealed:

- Lots of people head for navigation menus, whether they're universal (across the top), contextual (changing sidebars) or inline (impromptu tab bars). They're greedy for them. So: make sure you put anything important in your navigation menus.
- Your guinea pigs will ignore *anything* that looks like an advert. An advert generally consists of larger text, a heading and a marketing picture. Talking of which&hellip;
- Only use pictures of people or things that really exist in your organisation.
- Micro copy is all important. Choose the wrong word and they'll ignore your carefully designed signpost. The right word is the one your user describes something with, not your organisation.
- And most of all: *No&#8211;one reads online if they want to do something*. Sentences in search forms are a complete waste of time. Your search needs to just work (a right bastard when your search engine is crap).

This is all stuff La Nielsen told you 10 years ago, but it's *always* important to see it in action.

Test everything, especially the things you *think* are great. Salvage good stuff from the design you're improving. Don't take anything personally. Be flexible and change anything that doesn't work. All the normal stuff.
