title: Four things to avoid when building website navigation menus

Information architecture is difficult when your organisation offers lots of different services to lots of different people.

There are 3 stages to making information findable:

1. Research what information your users need (through some sort of task research)
2. Organise this information (through a card sort)
3. Implement an appropriate <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr>

Stage 3 is surprisingly difficult. Here are 4 mistakes I've made on the Suffolk Libraries website:

## 1. Not making labels concrete enough

We have a _Reading_ section on our website. _Reading_ as a label is OK; it performs fairly well in tests. However, _Branches_ is a lot better as it doesn't really leave any room for interpretation, whereas _reading_ covers a lot of activities and information.

Now, some things are easier to label than others &#8211; library branches are things you can touch. If you're dealing with something a bit more abstract try and be as specific as possible. _Reading_ is possibly too broad and vague, something like _Reading ideas_ is a lot clearer.

## 2. Not listing all sub levels in a navigation menu

The poor _Reading_ section. It's not that bad, it's just that it could be better.

On our website navigation menu we list 3 sections beneath _Reading_, namely _Book, music and film lists_, _Reading information and advice_ and _Lesleyâ€™s Readers_. In fact, there are a couple of other sections, including information about reading groups.

When we've asked users to find information about reading groups on our site they've struggled. We can tell they've correctly identified the _Reading_ section because they'll hover over that part of the navigation menu. But because there's no _Reading groups_ label they assume it's not there.

There are some good reasons for not listing _all_ sub levels, but it's probably better to either list all or none.

## 3. Making a navigation menu link a heading

Ah, our _Reading_ menu. A surprising number of users won't click on the _Reading_ link, probably because they think it's a heading, rather than a link. In fact it's both &#8211; which requires too much interpretation.

## 4. Using dropdowns

This probably seems draconian; after all, most corporate sites use dropdowns extensively. Yet our testing shows many users just don't get on with them.

If you choose to reveal a dropdown when the user hovers over a link you're giving them a little dexterity game to play. If, like us, you reveal dropdowns on click you make it difficult to select the top level menu. You're also assuming the user understands clicking the top level link will reveal the dropdown.

## Perfect navigation menus

Ideally, you wouldn't use dropdowns. You'd stick to single level menus and signpost pages, or you'd use headings and sub levels in a vertical menu.

The problem with changing navigation menus is that users get used to finding information in a certain way. Quite often they'll overcome poor structure or UI and happily make the same few clicks without thinking. Change things drastically and you risk annoying them.
