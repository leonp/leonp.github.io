[Vitor Lourenco](http://www.vlourenco.com/) is 21.  Blimey:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="560" caption="Just 4 big things to click, white space, clever alignment: 10 out of 10"]![Just 4 big things to click, white space, clever alignment: 10 out of 10](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3181/2933017693_8b6241884c_o.jpg)[/caption]

This page has just 4 big red things to click, which is clever in itself.  The quote's spot on and we're told everything we need to know in a couple of sentences.  The simplicity allows the designer to indulge in some big, uncommon fonts (Palatino) and there's even my beloved Garamond italic ampersand.  No graphics.

The red blocks give a great balance to the design.

<del>Makes my own home page seem like a mess</del>.  Update: I have taken [a leaf out of Vitor's book](http://leonpaternoster.com).

21?  I'm nearly old enough to be his dad.
