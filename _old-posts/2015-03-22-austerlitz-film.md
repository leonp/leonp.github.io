This is interesting. There's a French film adaptation of (or rather, a French film about) Sebald's masterpiece <cite>Austerlitz</cite>, something I was completely unaware of. Here's a trailer from the <i>[Foundation pour la MÃ©moire de la Shoah](http://www.fondationshoah.org/FMS/Austerlitz-un-film-de-Stan-Neumann)</i> website. Your French is better than mine:

All [these films _about_ Sebald's books](/2012/06/patience-after-sebald/).
