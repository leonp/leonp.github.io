It's fun to be able to see meaning in our name or place of birth. There's a Nabokov short story about a man who reads something personal in everything around him. It ends with a phone call (which is all I can remember of the story).

Paternoster Square (until 1942 Paternoster Row, when it was bombed by the Nazis, natch) was the book publishing centre of London (pleasing). It's the highest point in the city of London (I measure one metre ninety four, a smidgeon under six feet five inches), and in 2004 the stock exchange moved there (comic).
