title: A Tumblr theme
layout: post

I've had a go at building a Tumblr theme, mainly because the existing themes seem to get things like margins and heading line heights wrong. This makes me sad.

It's all pretty simple &#8211; I wish WordPress made it as easy to add custom fields for link colours etc.

My main problem with Tumblr is that it seems to generate big pages. Seems unnecessary for throwaway text sites.

Anyway:

- [See the Seriouser theme in action](http://leonp.tumblr.com)
- [Find Seriouser on Github](https://github.com/leonp/seriouser)

Known issues: I haven't figured out a way to make `iframe` responsive. On the plus side `video` seems to work OK. There are probably many other bugs; tweet me if you find any (@leonpaternoster).
