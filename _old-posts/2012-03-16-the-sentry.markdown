A free short story by Téa Obreht, winner of the 2011 Orange prize.

In a normal world the relationship between a dog and a 10 year old boy would be a sweet, sentimental thing. Instead, the dog shares a secret with its Serbian camp guard master, which lies behind some barbed wire in a Serbian concentration camp. The guard is the boy's father. Everything is quite calm but wrong.

This is an oblique examination of evil.
