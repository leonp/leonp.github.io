Despite its appearance on some recent websites, Times New Roman is an ineffective choice for body copy. Use Georgia instead.

The [New Yorker](http://newyorker.com) has undergone a recent redesign. There are plenty of modern web design cues present (a grid-based layout and some thoughtful typography for two), but it soon becomes clear that the designers have steered clear of one of the tenets of modern web typography: Use Georgia as your serif font.

This is a mistake.

A wordy site needs type that is clear to read. Times at anything below 18 pixels produces a cramped, uncomfortable experience for the reader. Screens are not print. This is [why Georgia was invented](http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm); it's a thicker Times with more distinct serifs, easy-to-read on a monitor.

One can only guess at the designers' motives for employing Times. Perhaps it's an attempt to evoke the traditions of The New Yorker's print version, or a rebellion against the omnipresence of Georgia. Whatever the reason, it's wrong. Readability always comes before design statements on the web.

If you're not convinced, look at the site using [my style](http://userstyles.org/styles/6815), or compare these screenshots:

And don't get me started on the paragraphs.
