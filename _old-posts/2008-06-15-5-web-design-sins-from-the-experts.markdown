title: 5 web design sins from the experts
category: work
---

As you can probably gather from this blog, I'm interested in the areas of **usability** and **accessibility** and how they relate to web design. There are some fabulous web designers out there, but the age old _apparent _conflict between attractiveness and accessibility sometimes flares up on their own web sites. Here I present 5 areas in which even the experts could improve:


## 1. Squinting is not fun


A perennial favourite. I think designers often find large, sans-serif text ugly. So a surprising number of sites still use really **small text**:

(From [Mark Boulton](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/index.php)'s web site).

Small text is difficult to read, even when given a generous leading. And 11 pixel Lucida is _too _small.


## 2. Where are the links?


Designers can be very creative when they style their links, but there are some [very sensible guidelines](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040510.html) that should be followed in order to ensure they are clear to all users (according to wikipedia, [6% of males are deuteranomalous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteranopia#Dichromacy)). If designers use red or green as their link colour they should ensure that the link is underlined, otherwise it becomes **indistinct** from the rest of the page:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="505" caption="Red, non-underlined links are indistinct from the rest of the text, as this screenshot from the Information Architects website shows"]![Red, non-underlined links are indistinct from the rest of the text, as this screenshot from the Information Architects website shows](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3283/2734991550_43021828ea_o.jpg)[/caption]

This is an example from [iA](http://informationarchitects.jp): superb designers who write extremely entertaining, oftimes controversial articles about design and the web.  But can you spot the link?  This is how some colour-blind readers see the page (screenshot made possible by the essential [ColorOracle](http://colororacle.cartography.ch/)).


## 3. Text is words, not pictures


The web and html are inherently flexible and copyable phenomena. If I read something I like on the web I should be able to **copy** it and manipulate it as I please (in a Word document, for example). Unfortunately for designers, there are only a few fonts that are 'safe' to use across the web. To get round this designers will go to extraordinary lengths, perhaps by using **images** instead of text:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="512" caption="An example of image replacement from Daniel Mall's site - beautiful fonts, but not copyable"]![An example of image replacement from Daniel Malls site - beautiful fonts, but not copyable](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3189/2734143481_54df729a14_o.jpg)[/caption]

(This is from [Daniel Mall](http://www.danielmall.com/)'s site - normally bold in its adherence to good old simple text and typography.)


## 4. Some fonts should stay on paper


[I've written about this before](http://leonpaternoster.com/2008/05/times-for-print-georgia-for-screen/). Unless it's being used as a large heading, Times is inappropriate for the screen. Georgia is a wonderful thing.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Times is scratchy on a screen when used as body copy"]![Times is cramped on the screen](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2475840215_b526132c42.jpg?v=0)[/caption]

## 5. Who turned the lights out?


I see this often when designers use dark backgrounds. **Contrast** is important for all users, not just the visually impaired:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="490" caption="Visually inventive, but the background colour and texture make the text indistinct"]![COntrast too low](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/2581963514_b8278b9558.jpg?v=0)[/caption]

So we can see that designers often make decisions that affect the usability and accessibility of their sites. Is this a disaster, or quibbling?
