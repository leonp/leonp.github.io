title: Labour's marketing politics
---

_Mondeo Man_, _White Van Man_, _squeezed middle_, _aspirational working class_, _white working class_ &#8211; [Labour's search for a constituency continues apace](http://labourlist.org/2015/06/memo-to-the-new-leader-britains-real-middle/). Just as long as it's not the 'something for nothing' culture.

This marketing approach to politics, beloved of Blair, has surely had its day. Rather than simply define a set of problems that affect lots of people and then suggest ways we might solve them, Labour currently seems hell bent on finding an audience first.

This is symptomatic of a chronic lack of confidence; a fear or lack of any coherent identity, purpose or ideology. Until it figures out what it's for rather than what segment of the population it needs to target, we'll witness a gruesome parade of prospective leaders formulating more and more meaningless slogans &#8211; and then maybe select the most more&#8211;or&#8211;less&#8211;electable Labour leader.
