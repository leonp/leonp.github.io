**A few stories** tagged onto The Kreuzer Sonata. A bit meh, apart from some somewhat socialist visions of the future in Ivan the Fool. Tolstoy imagines modern warfare:


> But Simeon's intentions reached the ears of the Indian ruler, who
prepared to do battle with him. In addition to having secured all
the latest implements of warfare, he added still others of his own
invention. He ordered all boys over fourteen and all single women to
be drafted into the army, until its proportions became much larger than
Simeon's. His cannons and rifles were of the same pattern as Simeon's,
and he invented a flying-machine from which bombs could be thrown into
the enemy's camp.

Simeon went forth to conquer the Viceroy with full confidence in his own
powers to succeed. This time luck forsook him, and instead of being the
conqueror he was himself conquered.

The Indian ruler had so arranged his army that Simeon could not even
get within shooting distance, while the bombs from the flying-machine
carried destruction and terror in their path, completely routing his
army, so that Simeon was left alone.


These stories are moralistic and patronising, but, this being Tolstoy, there is some fantastic rhythm and tension. Best of all is Polikushka's suicide and the preceding cart ride home:


> But Polikey failed to follow the girl, and went instead to another place.

From the porch of his house there was a ladder reaching to the attic. Arriving at the foot of the ladder Polikey looked around him, and seeing no one about, he quickly ascended to the garret.


Finished this a while back. Naughty Leon, neglecting the reading journal.
