Harry poses an interesting question:

> Is there a word for the practice of sugar&#8211;coating deplorable business models with a fantastic customer experience? <cite>[Harry Brignull](https://twitter.com/harrybr/status/597645650709327872)</cite>

Rather obviously, and not particularly amusingly, I came up with <i>Amazonification</i> (even the though the sound of it&hellip;) <i>Uberfication</i> would probably be better.

As I've noted before, [my experience of Amazon&#8217;s customer service](/2014/09/amazon-service-conundrum/) is indeed amazing. And as we all know, Amazon treats its workers like crap.

I'm not averse to a bit of [customer experience evangelism](/2013/06/libraries-should-invest-millions-in-search-engines/) myself &#8211; library websites traditionally provide a miserable search and discover experience. Improving library websites _should_ make libraries more attractive to more people.

But there is something &#8211; what? &#8211; sinister, complicit, underhand, obfuscatory, smoke and mirrors? &#8211; in this quest to provide an excellent customer experience. As with all transactions, there's an element of supply _and_ demand, and as consumers we willingly concentrate on only one part of the transaction &#8211; _our_ experience.

What price excellent customer service? Or rather, what price for refusing to look at what happens behind the scenes? I'm not saying excellent experience and grubby ethics are necessarily linked, but perhaps we shouldn't be blinded by a wonderful, shiny, cheap service _every_ time.
