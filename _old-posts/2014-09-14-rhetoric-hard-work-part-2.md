title: The rhetoric of hard work (part 2)

OK, so this <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/13/endies-employed-no-disposable-income-struggling-in-london">Guardian piece on the working poor</a> makes some sound suggestions, such as building affordable houses. But several things annoy, not least the <i>Endies</i> moniker. You can picture the <cite>Guardian</cite> and <cite>Standard</cite> style sections already. *Endie chic*.

Yes, <a href="/2014/09/in-my-experience/">it is especially expensive in London</a>, but I'm sure every town and city in the UK suffers from low pay and high living costs.

But what really pissed me off was this:

> &#8220;&hellip; endies don't complain&hellip;&#8221; said Ben Rogers, director of the Centre for London. &#8220;They take pride in working hard, and make an essential contribution&hellip;&#8221;

How does Rogers know that his shiny new social group takes pride in working hard? How does he even know they work hard? Why the hardworking romanticism?

As I've noted before, <a href="/2012/12/the-rhetoric-of-hard-work/">the rhetoric of hard work is damaging to those who have to work to barely cover their living expenses</a>. By making a virtue out of hard work, and not &#8216;moaning&#8217; about it, Rogers reaffirms the myth that, in the natural order of things, <a href="/2014/06/the-morality-of-work/">hard work somehow equates to prosperity</a> &#8211; that it's an end in itself. If you're pliant and passive, all the better: you won't question how inheritance, landlordism and going to the right school are far more important than expending lots of effort.

And where does this leave those who are unemployed or in part&#8211;time work &#8211; those who can't be a part of the cult of hard work?
