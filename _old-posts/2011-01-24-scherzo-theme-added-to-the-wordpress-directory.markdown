title: Scherzo theme added to the WordPress directory

Today I got a short, jolly email from the WordPress theme reviewers:


> Congratulations, your new theme Scherzo is now available to the public at <[http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo)>


Scherzo is the first theme I submitted to the theme directory, and it took quite a bit of work to knock into shape. If you develop themes I thoroughly recommend going 'official'; you'll learn a few things about WordPress and you'll produce something that'll be of more value to bloggers. Incidentally, the reviewers do a great job.

God knows if anyone'll bother downloading the theme and how they'll rate it, but I'm glad I did it.

Anyway: [go fill your boots](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/scherzo).
