Reading eminent WordPress blogger [Justin Tadlock's latest post on his goals for 2011](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2011/01/17/2011-goals). The first — to read more — should be on everyone's list, of course, but it's interesting that Justin quantifies his target. Two books a month _seems_ an achievable target, doesn't it?

It depends on your reading. What are you reading? Is it long? Is it ‘difficult’? How well do you read — do you skim, skip sections or chapters even? Are you reading novels, history, books about HTML5, other non–fiction? When can/do you read? Are you tired when you read? Do you read between changing nappies? Do you read on the way into work? On a train? On the toilet? Late at night? In a chair? In a bed? Are you lucky enough to have long days free for reading?

I read serious literature (natch) and, at the moment, it all appears to be pretty long. My current book is Jonathan Franzen's _Freedom_ and  recent novels include _Anna Karenina_, _City of God_ and _Austerlitz_; all weighty tomes. What's more I like to think I read _properly_; never skipping a word, re–reading sentences and paragraphs, checking back for events, names and images. (Aside: Did I read badly in my teenage years and at university? I certainly read _more_. I wonder if I took whatever I wanted from a book and discarded the rest.)

Two books a month? Sounds a lot to me. Let's see by keeping a list.
