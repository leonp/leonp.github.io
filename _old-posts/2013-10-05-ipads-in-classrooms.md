According to <cite>Hechinger Report</cite>, [a scheme to roll out iPads for students in California has been an unmitigated disaster][1] (via [@joeclark][2]).

iPads *seem* such a good idea in the classroom – and on many a middle manager&#8217;s presentation they&#8217;re modern! hitech! exciting! – but in real life they&#8217;re a nightmare.

Apart from the hassle of getting them from room A to B, keeping them charged, stopping students from spending the lesson on Facebook, saving work so it can be used next lesson and synching with Dropbox when there&#8217;s no continuous connection, iPads aren&#8217;t actually very good for writing, taking photos or video. Pens, cameras and camcorders are far better.<figure class="figure alignnone">

The one thing an iPad *is* good for is research: it&#8217;s quicker to whip out a tablet and google the [battle of Mametz Wood][3] than schlep off to the computer room.

Of course, you don&#8217;t *need* an iPad to do research. A [Hudl][4] – 119 quid compared with 269 for an iPad mini – is more than adequate. But [in education as elsewhere, Apple is king][5]. And an iPad looks better in all those publicity shots.
