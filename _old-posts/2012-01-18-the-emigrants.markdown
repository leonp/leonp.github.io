It is good to be reading Sebald again. Had a rather odd moment when a description of something suggested Nabokov catching butterflies in the mountains. I turned the page and there was a photo (which I have in my _Nabokov's Butterflies_ collection) of Nabokov, beshorted, clutching a butterfly net.

The meaning in Sebald is suggested through allusion and the structure of the narrative; the length and rhythm of the sentences and paragraphs. Dr Henry Selwyn is short and tall, circumstantial and expansive at the same time.

(_completed 27 Jan_): This is a wonderful book. I love the way Sebald develops life stories; how the first person narrator meets a character who narrates their story, and how that story is developed detail by detail, layer by layer. There are four discrete stories in _The Emigrants_ which are linked through oblique images and themes; catching butterflies (and Nabokov), Manchester, the Alpine lakes, hats, German art. The final pages need deciphering; the _daughters of the night_.
