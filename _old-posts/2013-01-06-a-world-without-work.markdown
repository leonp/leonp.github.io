Article on work's real meaning and value: [A world without work](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/03/world-without-work), by Nina Power.

Disappointing to see [Labour cannot rid itself of Thatcher's language](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20621313), even in these dog days. Strivers, shirkers, feckless--what nonsense. Presumably this resonates with people. The rhetoric starts at school.
