I'm Leon Paternoster, digital and customer service manager at [Suffolk Libraries](http://suffolklibraries.co.uk) (I work under the job title of deputy head of IT). We're a mutual formed in 2012 to run Suffolk's library service.

We design, build and manage our website in house, and fit several external services such as the catalogue of physical titles and ebook service into it.

I set up (and continue to manage) our customer service team, as well as run IT projects such as [designing our own self-service software](/2016/02/5-day-sprint-clear-left-self-service/).

In previous lives I've been a newspaper ad salesperson, telecoms engineer and teacher of English. If you were looking for a common thread you might argue I've always been interested in communication, user experience and technology.

I figure out what organisations should do online, especially not for profits who don't have the resources to employ a full web team.

This involves lots of things, including research, coding, testing, writing style guides, digital strategy, social media and commissioning.

I've published blog posts since 2008 on web design and writing, my work, politics, books, philosophy and other bits and pieces. These are my thoughts and opinions, not those of someone else, my employer or you.
