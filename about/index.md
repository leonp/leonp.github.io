<p>I work for Suffolk Libraries. We're a mutual formed in 2012 to run Suffolk's Library service.</p>

<p>We design, build and manage our website in house, and fit several external services such as the catalogue of physical titles and ebook service into it.</p>

<p>I also set up and manage our customer service team.</p>

<p>In previous lives I've been a newspaper ad salesperson, telecoms engineer and teacher of English. If you were looking for a common thread you might argue I've always been interested in communication, user experience and technology.</p>

<p>I figure out what organisations should do online, especially not for profits who don't have the resources to employ a full web team.</p>

<p>This involves lots of things, including research, coding, testing, writing style guides, digital strategy, social media and commissioning.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've published blog posts since 2008, writing about web design and writing, my work, politics, books, philosophy and other bits and pieces.</p>
