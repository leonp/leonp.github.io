I'm web and customer service manager at <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a> (although I go under the fairly grandiose title of deputy head of IT).

We're a mutual that was formed in 2012 to run Suffolk's Library service.

We design, build and manage our website in house, and fit several external services such as the catalogue of physical titles and ebook service into it.

In previous lives I've been a newspaper ad salesperson, telecoms engineer and teacher of English. If you were looking for a common thread you might argue I've always been interested in communication, user experience and technology.

I figure out what organisations should do online. This involves:

- Researching customer requirements
- Testing designs with customers
- Writing style guides
- Writing a strategy
- Deciding when to develop services in house
- Writing content guidelines
- Managing social media
