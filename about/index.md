> Simplicity, usefulness, functionality, details and facts, transparency; these are the pillars of the new digital design. <cite><a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/era-distrust-and-disloyalty">The era of distrust and disloyalty, Gerry McGovern</a></cite>

I'm web and customer service manager at <a href="http://suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a> (although I go under the fairly grandiose title of deputy head of IT).

We're a mutual that was formed in 2012 to run Suffolk's Library service.

We design, build and manage our website in house, and fit several external services (such as the catalogue of physical titles and ebook service) into that.

In previous lives I've been a newspaper ad salesperson, telecoms engineer and teacher of English. If you were looking for a common thread you might argue I've always been interested in communication, user experience and technology.

I figure out what organisations should do online. This involves answering questions like:

- What do our customers want to do online?
- How do we help our customers do what they want to do online?
- How do we write for the web?
- When can we develop services in house?
- Who's responsible for producing, editing and publishing content?
- What content can we get rid of?
- What social media do we use?
- How do we use social media?
