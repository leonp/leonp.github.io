I'm Leon, deputy head of IT at [Suffolk Libraries](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk). I manage our web and customer service teams, as well as [several IT projects](/2016/02/5-day-sprint-clear-left-self-service/). I also help manage our network and staff and public PCs.

Suffolk County Council contracts us to run the county's library service.

We design, build and manage our website in house, integrating it with several external services such as the catalogue of physical titles and ebook downloads. We manage PCs for 400 staff, hundreds of public PCs and our staff and public networks.

In previous lives I've been a newspaper ad salesperson, telecoms engineer and teacher of English. If you were looking for a common thread you might argue I've always been interested in communication, user experience and technology.

I've published blog posts since 2008 on web design and writing, my work, politics, books, philosophy and other bits and pieces. These are my thoughts and opinions, not those of someone else, my employer or you.
